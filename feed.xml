                <title>The Beginning - Some ridiculously long title to test the layout in different IE versions</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Just what the world needs, yet another technical blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;John Novak&lt;/strong&gt; and I’ve been working as a professional programmer
ever since I left uni in 2003. In those last 12+ years I have worked in
a variety of industries using lots of different programming languages, most
notably C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript and PHP. I’ll spare you from the
gory details, you can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnovak1979&quot;&gt;LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; if you’re really
that interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my teenager years I was fairly involved with the Amiga and PC
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene&quot;&gt;demoscene&lt;/a&gt; as a graphician and musician. That was also the time when
I taught myself coding in Pascal, x86 assembly and C as a hobby (in that exact
order). I still write &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnnovak.net/#music&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; in my spare time and do
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photo.johnnovak.net/&quot;&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt;, plus occasionally dabble in design (such as the visuals
of this blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 5+ years, my programming jobs involved me to focus quite heavily
on the server-side development side of things, mostly in Java and now recently
in Scala. While that’s a very interesting and rewarding area to work in with
a lot of depth to it, I’ve come to realise that it’s just too easy to fall
into a comfortable routine and become an expert in an area while
simultaneously missing out on all the exciting new stuff that’s happening in
the world of programming outside your particular niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the main motivation for starting this blog—to keep myself up to
date on new technologies that interest me and document my tinkerings. The idea
is that using the blog format to report on my experiments will help me
focus and also make me more diligent in researching my topics.  After all, the
goal is to write about things that are new to me, so trying to keep the amount
of misinformation I’m unwillingly (but inevitably) going spread to a minimum
is probably a good idea, as I’m sure the experts will be far too eager to
chime in and correct me… :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, don’t hesitate to point out any of my factual mistakes in
the comments. In fact, I’d be glad if you did and I encourage you to do so
because I’m here to learn. That offer stands for correcting my grammar as well
as English is not my first language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough of rambling about myself already, see you in the next post!&lt;/p&gt;
