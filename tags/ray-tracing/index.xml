I needed a way to calculate normals for the box primitive in my ray tracer.</description></item><item><title>The Nim Ray Tracer Project --- Part 3: Lighting &amp; Vector Maths</title><link>http://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/10/15/the-nim-ray-tracer-project-part-3-lighting-vector-maths/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/10/15/the-nim-ray-tracer-project-part-3-lighting-vector-maths/</guid><description>[Listening Esoterica from Dan Pound. Very reminiscent of the Steve Roach type of tribal/electronic ambient, which is always a good thing in my book. Parts 1, 2, 6 &amp;amp; 7 are my personal highlights.]
Ok, so last time I ended my post with the cliffhanger that I&amp;rsquo;m going to show some actual Nim code in the next episode, which is this. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll never make foolish promises like that again, I swear!</description></item><item><title>The Nim Ray Tracer Project --- Part 2: The Basics</title><link>http://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/04/30/the-nim-ray-tracer-project-part-2-the-basics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/04/30/the-nim-ray-tracer-project-part-2-the-basics/</guid><description>[I have to tell that even after 34 years, Brian Eno&amp;rsquo;s ambient music is still so much better than 99.9999% of all recent electronic releases.

Why a ray tracer? I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by ray tracing since my childhood. I still remember the first time I was playing around with an early 3D modeller/ray tracer program on the Amiga 500 called Imagine when I was about 13, trying to render some extruded letters made of glass placed on a classic checker-board patterned surface (don&amp;rsquo;t laugh, this was sort of a novel thing to do at that time, and I was a kid).</description></item></channel></rss>
