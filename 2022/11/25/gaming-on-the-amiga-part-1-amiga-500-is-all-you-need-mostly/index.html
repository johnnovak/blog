days is via WHDLoad on an Amiga 1200 expanded with a turbo card and lots of
extra RAM (either emulated or real hardware). I disagree with this notion.</p><p>Frankly, this has been bothering me for quite some time. WHDLoad is simply
<em>not</em> the magic ultimate solution many people make it out to be, and there are
much simpler ways to play games from the hard drive (especially when using
emulators), if avoiding disk swapping is your goal. WHDLoad has a number of
drawbacks that range from mere annoyances to game-breaking problems. At the
very least, it needlessly complicates things when a much simpler solution
would often suffice, and makes the experience generally inauthentic. The
various glitches and problems might put Amiga games in a bad light for people
new to the platform, and annoy oldtimers like me who are after replicating the
Authentic Original Experience™.</p><p>While I agree that grabbing some hard drive image that comes pre-installed
with all WHDLoad games in the known universe is certainly the method that
requires the <em>least amount of effort</em> (especially for newcomers who don&rsquo;t want
to learn about the Amiga), I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the best or ideal way to
experience Amiga games. So in this article series I am going to challenge this
recommendation, explain the reason for WHDLoad&rsquo;s existence, highlight some of
the problems with it, then present a much more authentic (and in my view,
better) way of playing these classic games on a hard drive equipped Amiga 500.
I will focus on setting things up in an emulator (WinUAE), but the method
certainly works on a real computer too.</p><h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2><p>This guide assumes some basic familiarity with the Amiga line of home
computers. If you&rsquo;ve never used one of these magnificient machines before, or
if you want to get back into the hobby after several decades without having
used one, I highly recommend reading the excellent <a href=https://www.amigaretro.com/index.php/page,1.html>Amiga Beginner&rsquo;s
Series</a> first. It covers a
lot of ground quite succintly, and if not everything makes complete sense,
don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll explain the important things in more detail later. But you
<em>need</em> to understand the basics first, and without a desire to have some basic
level of technical understanding on how the Amigas work, you won&rsquo;t get very
far. Personal computers from the 80s and 90s are not consoles; every user
(including gamers) was expected to have some minimal knowledge of the
hardware to be able to use it effectively.</p><p>Another very important thing: Amiga games just look wrong without properly
emulating a period-correct CRT monitor, so I very much recommend referencing
<a href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/>my earlier
article</a>
on setting up an authentic Commodore 1084S shader setup for WinUAE before
getting started.</p><h2 id=a-brief-history-of-the-amiga>A brief history of the Amiga</h2><p>The first Amiga ever, the iconic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1000>Amiga
1000</a> was released in 1985 to the
unsuspecting public, followed by the more budget oriented <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500>Amiga
500</a> in 1987. These were simply the
best home computers money could buy at that time, it was unbelievable &mdash; as
if someone time-travelled <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535694/the-future-was-here/>back from the
future</a> to bring
the world&rsquo;s first true multimedia computer to us (no, it wasn&rsquo;t the Macintosh,
neither the much later &ldquo;multimedia Pentium PCs&rdquo;).</p><p>The Amiga 500 featured the same Motorola 68000 processor running at 7.14 MHz,
and nearly the same <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set>Original Chip Set
(OCS)</a> as the Amiga 1000. In
Amiga terms, the chipset defines the graphics capabilities of the machine. The
OCS chipset was capable of displaying a palette of up to 32 colours out of
4096 (64 in the special <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Halfbrite_mode>Extra Half-Brite
(EHB)</a> mode, and all
possible colours in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold-And-Modify>Hold-And-Modify
(HAM)</a>, but this was only
utilised in a handful of games). The most common screen modes for games were
320×256 (PAL) and 320×200 (NTSC), but some made good use of the
640×256/200 hi-res resolutions as well.</p><p>The other important defining characteristic of an Amiga computer is the
version of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Amiga)>Kickstart</a>,
which is the firmware part of the operating system. This resided in a ROM chip
on the Amiga 500 and later models. Kickstart 1.3 was <em>the</em> standard Kickstart
for the Amiga 500, but some early models came with version 1.2. Earlier
versions than that were very buggy beta releases and thus can be safely
ignored.</p><p>Now, the Amiga 500 was a tremendous success, it sold several millions of units
worldwide (the exact figure is a never-ending point of contention). It should
be of little surprise then that the overwhelming majority of the Amiga gaming
catalogue was targeting OCS equipped Amigas with 1 MB of RAM running Kickstart
1.3 &mdash; in other words, the ubiquitous Amiga 500, the most popular Amiga model
ever, with a 512k RAM expansion board which was de-facto standard. This is
quite understandable, as the relatively low price point of the Amiga 500 made
it a very attactive choice for parents wanting to buy a personal computer for
their kids (IBM PC compatibles with similar capabilities could easily cost 3
to 5 times more in Europe). And those &ldquo;similar capabilities&rdquo; of the PCs
haven&rsquo;t really materialised until about 1989 (with some goodwill), the year
the Sound Blaster 1.0 was released, and it took a few more years for the VGA
adapters (originally released in 1987) to come down in price so ordinary
people on regular salaries could afford them (especially outside of the US).</p><p>The next major chipset generation was the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Advanced_Graphics_Architecture>Amiga Advanced Graphics
Architecture
(AGA)</a>
that found its way into the successor of the Amiga 500 in the budget category,
the Amiga 1200 released at the end of 1992. It was a rather lackluster
incremental upgrade over the OCS and the shortlived ECS chipset (which is
unimportant from a gaming perspective). At this point, Commodore was basically
just playing catchup with the IBM PC compatibles. Although AGA made the use of
256 colours out of a total palette of 16 million possible, similarly to the
VGA standard released in 1987 (note the huge 5 year gap there!), it was an
architectural dead-end. No improvements had been made to the Amiga&rsquo;s sound
capabilities at all (I don&rsquo;t count the removal of the fixed low-pass filter as
an improvement); it was the exact same 4-channel / 8-bit / up to ~28.8kHz
audio the Amiga 1000 introduced in 1985. At the same time, 1992 saw the
release of landmark PC audio cards such as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16>Sound Blaster
16</a> (CD-quality audio, FM
synthesis, optional MIDI daughterboard) and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravis_UltraSound>Gravis
UltraSound</a> (CD-quality
audio, 32 channels, hardware mixer, up to 1 MB of sample RAM). From about 1992
onwards, you could no longer proudly recommend Amiga versions of games as the
&ldquo;best&rdquo; versions; the PC had simply taken over and became the leading platform.
Amiga ports had become mostly just afterthoughs, ranging from mediocre to
bad. With the eventual demise of Commodore in 1994, developers started to
abandon the platform in droves, and the fate of the Amiga as a mainstream
gaming platform was sealed. One could argue that the final nail in the coffin
was the release of DOOM a bit earlier in 1993, establishing the hugely popular
FPS genre. It was simply impossible to achieve a similarly fast-paced 3D
gameplay on a stock Amiga 1200 with the AGA chipset. Regardless of the
importantce of DOOM in the downfall of the Amiga, the new lines of machines
could simply not keep up with the fast advancements in the 3D accelerated
graphics arena, and that&rsquo;s what most gamers wanted.</p><p>All in all, while the Amiga 1000/500 were revolutionary at their inception,
the Amiga 1200 offered only a rather modest evolutionary upgrade to that
classic machine, and overall it was a disappointment. It was too little, and
far too late. Naturally, there are <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=86674">long forum
threads</a> discussing this in
painstaking detail, with lots zealotry, name calling, emotions running mile
high, and &mdash; surprisingly! &mdash; even the occasional valuable insight and
factual information there if you&rsquo;re persistent enough (I couldn&rsquo;t muster up
the strength to get past the 21st page myself&mldr;) My feelings about the
eventual death-spiral of the Amiga and the <a href=https://qr.ae/pvf5zR>general incompetency of Commodore
management</a> is summed up pretty well in this comment:</p><blockquote><p>I was disappointed but it&rsquo;s like being disappointed with one of your family, you ignore the negatives and love it anyway.</p></blockquote><h2 id=ocs-vs-aga>OCS vs AGA</h2><p>But instead of entering endless subjective debates, let&rsquo;s look at some actual
numbers! Thanks to the <a href=https://hol.abime.net/>Hall of Light</a> online
database, I was able to collect some statistics on the number of commercially
released Amiga games &mdash; looking at the OCS and AGA numbers separately is
pretty revealing. I&rsquo;ve included the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32>CD32</a> as well; although it was
basically an Amiga 1200 with a CD-ROM (plus the vastly underutilised
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_custom_chips#Akiko>Akiko</a> chip), I think
it warrants its own category. You can check out the raw numbers and the
database queries I used
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15eBazUr5dA2aRdaWNpa4Fi-1Coex0sMTH6nY_hDKXF8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>As we can see, the total number of AGA and CD32 games dwindle in comparison to
OCS:</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/all-releases.png data-pswp-width=2129 data-pswp-height=1052><img src=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/all-releases.png alt="Commercial Amiga game releases between 1985&ndash;2003" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><p>The chart quite nicely illustrates that gaming on the Amiga started in the earnest
in 1988, a year after the affordable Amiga 500 came out. There was a
golden-age period until about 1991/92, after which the number of releases
plummeted due to the increasing popularity of DOS gaming. The release of the
AGA architecture could not reverse this trend; the Amiga 1200 did not sell that
well, and quite understandably, developers were reluctant to target anything
else than the least common dominator, which was still the Amiga 500. The decline
continued until the bankruptcy of Commodore in 1994, after which things took
an even sharper downwards turn. It takes a lot of goodwill <em>not</em> to declare the
Amiga officially dead as a mainstream gaming platform by 1997.</p><p>These numbers actually put AGA releases into a much better light because most
of them were in fact just rehashes (read: cash-grabs) of earlier OCS games
with minor graphical upgrades. Many people (me included) think the OCS
originals have more character, and are thus the definitive versions. Another
sizable chuck of the AGA releases were phoned-in ports of DOS VGA games. Sure,
back in the day every Amiga owner was happy for whatever they could still get
for their aging platform, but there&rsquo;s very little sense in preferring these
lackluster ports to the genuine article today (apart from historical interest, perhaps), which are the DOS originals.</p><p>I am personally not interested in action games much (apart from classic
action-adventures, such as <a href=https://hol.abime.net/3274>Another World</a>, <a href=https://hol.abime.net/568>Flashback</a>, <a href=https://hol.abime.net/1235>Rick
Dangerous</a> or <a href=https://hol.abime.net/1150>Prince or Persia</a> that require some thinking apart from quick reflexes), so let&rsquo;s take a closer look at my favourite genres: adventures, strategy games, and RPGs.</p><p>There are a handful of AGA ports of these games that have better music on
the Amiga still, and there are the AGA/CD32 exclusives, but both pools are pretty small.
So small that I&rsquo;ll list every single adventure, RPG, and strategy game that
fall into these special categories and are worth playing on the Amiga in my
view.</p><p>But first, let&rsquo;s look at the general trends:</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/adventure-releases.png data-pswp-width=2129 data-pswp-height=1052><img src=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/adventure-releases.png alt="Commercial Amiga adventure & action adventure releases between 1985&ndash;2003" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/strategy-releases.png data-pswp-width=2129 data-pswp-height=1052><img src=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/strategy-releases.png alt="Commercial Amiga strategy releases between 1985&ndash;2003" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/rpg-releases.png data-pswp-width=2129 data-pswp-height=1052><img src=/2022/11/25/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need-mostly/img/rpg-releases.png alt="Commercial Amiga RPG releases between 1985&ndash;2003" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><p>No big suprises here, but it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see the abrupt drop in the
number of new releases in 1993 in both the adventure and RPG categories. My
guess is that this is the result of major American developers seeing the
writing on the wall and abandoning the platform (a significant portion of the
more cerebral Amiga games were American made).</p><p>Finally, here are the results in numeric format:</p><table style=width:70%><caption>Number of commercial Amiga game releases 1985–2003</caption><tr><th width=24%>Percentage</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>All</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>OCS</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>AGA</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>CD32</th></tr><tr><td>All genres</td><td style=text-align:right>100.0%</td><td style=text-align:right>89.7%</td><td style=text-align:right>6.5%</td><td style=text-align:right>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure</td><td style=text-align:right>13.4%</td><td style=text-align:right>12.4%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.8%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Strategy</td><td style=text-align:right>5.5%</td><td style=text-align:right>4.7%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.5%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.3%</td></tr><tr><td>RPG</td><td style=text-align:right>3.1%</td><td style=text-align:right>2.5%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.4%</td><td style=text-align:right>0.2%</td></tr><tr><th width=24%>Totals</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>All</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>OCS</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>AGA</th><th width=19% style=text-align:right>CD32</th></tr><tr><td>All genres</td><td style=text-align:right>3727</td><td style=text-align:right>3343</td><td style=text-align:right>244</td><td style=text-align:right>140</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure</td><td style=text-align:right>501</td><td style=text-align:right>462</td><td style=text-align:right>28</td><td style=text-align:right>11</td></tr><tr><td>Strategy</td><td style=text-align:right>205</td><td style=text-align:right>174</td><td style=text-align:right>20</td><td style=text-align:right>11</td></tr><tr><td>RPG</td><td style=text-align:right>114</td><td style=text-align:right>93</td><td style=text-align:right>15</td><td style=text-align:right>6</td></tr></table><h2 id=non-ocs-adventure-rpg-and-strategy-games-worth-playing>Non-OCS adventure, RPG, and strategy games worth playing</h2><p>Okay, so we have unequivocally established that the target platform

rather well written:</p><blockquote><p>The primary reason for this loader is that a large number of computer games
for the Amiga don&rsquo;t properly interact with the AmigaOS operating system, but
instead run directly on the Amiga hardware, making assumptions about
specific control registers, memory locations, etc. The hardware of newer
Amiga models had been greatly revised, causing these assumptions to break
when trying to run the same games on newer hardware, and vice versa with
newer games on older hardware. WHDLoad provides a way to install such games
on an AmigaOS-compatible hard drive and run on newer hardware. An added
benefit is the avoidance of loading times and disk swaps, because everything
the game needs is stored on the hard drive.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, people got fed up with the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t play some of
their old Amiga 500 OCS games on their new AGA machines, and came up with a
solution around 1996, which was WHDLoad. The added benefit was that it also
allowed to run the supported games from the hard drive. Keep in mind that most
people sold their old Amiga 500 and put the money towards buying an Amiga
1200, so for many this was the only option to play those old games.</p><p>So far so good, what&rsquo;s not to like? Quite a few things, actually. In order to
work its magic, every supported game needs a so-called WHDLoad &ldquo;slave&rdquo; written
for it that can perform a number of interesting (and complex) things:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Patch the game code</strong> so it runs correctly (or rather, with minimal
issues) on the AGA chipset with fast memory present and on faster
processors (68020 at 14MHz is the minimum for an A1200). This definitely
sounds like a good thing, but it&rsquo;s not always possible to do 100% perfectly
for all games, resulting in sync and timing issues. Also, if not all of
these incompatibilities have been patched up, that can result in bugs or
crashes. But that&rsquo;s just the nature of the beast; you need to put your trust
in the author of the WHDLoad slave if you&rsquo;re going down this route. You&rsquo;re
not just dealing with the original game code anymore, but an additional layer on
top of that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emulate the environment</strong> the game expects, for example, an older
Kickstart version or some specific memory layout. Many older,
OS-unfriendly games expect a fixed memory layout (e.g. a stock A500 with
the extra 512K slow RAM), and would crash on any other setup. So the slave
needs to emulate the old Kickstart in software, and do various magical
things to fool the game into believing it runs from a floppy on a say
stock Amiga 500 with Kickstart 1.2. All these machinations require extra
memory; in fact, only a few WHDLoad games can run on a stock A1200 with 2
MB chip RAM. At least 8 MB fast RAM is recommended, but preferably more.
This is not a big deal when using an emulator, but&mldr; I just don&rsquo;t like
it. It&rsquo;s too much complexity, there&rsquo;s so much room for things to go wrong
compared to a simple Amiga 500 setup the game was coded for (but I admit,
all this machinery is very quite cool from a purely technical point of
view).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow hiscores and savegames to be stored on the hard drive</strong>. Again, a
cool feature on paper, but many of these games could only store such
things on floppies, often bypassing the OS completely. So the game needs
to be patched to write this data into some kind of temporary buffer in
memory, then when the buffer fills up, AmigaOS needs to be swapped back
into the memory space now occupied by the game to be able to write the
buffer to disk (it&rsquo;s not possible to access the HD without the OS, and
many older floppy games start by killing the OS). Then the game code needs
to be swapped back, and this goes back and forth for a while. Usually this
results in a black screen, and it can slow things down quite a bit (it&rsquo;s
referred to as &ldquo;OS swapping&rdquo;). Some slaves only perform the writes when
exiting the game, as an attempt to minimise the number of OS swaps, but if
you forget to properly quit the game, or worse, the game crashes on you,
all your <em>saved</em> (!) progress from your session is lost&mldr; I think this is
the #1 issue that gets every WHDLoad newbie, and I certainly did lose my
progress more than once by forgetting to exit the game. Although I&rsquo;m not
100% certain about the technical explanation, such slowdowns can also
affect games that perform lots of reads during the game, often slowing
down these loading times 2-5-fold! Sometimes the WHDLoad version runs
<em>slower</em> than the floppy version, which is plain unacceptable&mldr;</p></li><li><p><strong>Remove copy protection</strong> from games that used nefarious disk-based
protection schemes and/or custom non-DOS disk formats. Although the majority
of WHDLoad conversions require original uncracked floppy images, removing
such protections is a necessity and effectively requires cracking the game.
Sure, not having to consult code wheels and manuals every time you start the
game sounds like a good thing, but this comes with all the drawbacks
associated with cracking; a bad crack can simply render your game
unplayable. This is certainly annoying in action games and platformers that
take a few hours tops to finish (and therefore are easy to test by the
crackers), but with adventure games and especially RPGs that can take
anywhere between 20 and 100 hours to complete, a bad crack can be
catastrophic. Some devious developers had literally woven the protection
into the fabric of the game&rsquo;s code; it wasn&rsquo;t just a simple
question/response style manual or code wheel check at the beginning, but the
protection was <em>embedded</em> into the game, so to speak. Moreover, there was no
indication whatsoever of failing these subtle checks, the game did not
outright stop or crash but let you keep playing for hours on end while
gradually crippling the experience until it got into an unwinnable state,
possibly even corrupting or &ldquo;infecting&rdquo; your save files. Needless to say,
very few crackers had spent 20-100 hours to complete such games over and
over to test their cracks (just think of a complex branching RPG and how
much effort it would be to properly test that). Here&rsquo;s a few notable examples:</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate:_Gates_of_Dawn>Fate: Gates of Dawn</a>, one
of the longest and best RPGs Amiga-exclusive RPGs:</p><blockquote><p>It is notable that from these copies of the game only the copy protection
but not the password protection was removed. Password requests are not made
at the start of the game but at intervals in the game repeated after some
time. Just ignoring these requests or a wrong answer leads not to an abrupt
end to the game, but gameplay deteriorating until it becomes unplayable.
Therefore, a copy of the manual is still required for the right code.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=https://tcrf.net/Dungeon_Master_(Amiga)>ingenious</a> <a href="https://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/210">protection</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VheNpiSZxf0&t=489s">scheme</a> of <a href=https://hol.abime.net/441>Dungeon Master</a> had received a lot of respect
from crackers back in the day; I took them a year to fully reverse engineer it. The
protection definitely had served its purpose in this particular case!</p><blockquote><p>Additional anti-piracy checks exist in the code, including further fuzzy bit
sector reading, checksums, code hidden as images in GRAPHICS.DAT, and other
fun tricks intended to slow down and frustrate crackers. These respond with
a delay-action effect [&mldr;] It is still possible to complete the game if you
save progress frequently. These checks only hinder progress rather than
making the game impossible.</p></blockquote><p>This commenter is probably <a href=https://hackaday.com/2019/06/25/copy-protection-in-the-80s-showcased-by-classic-game-dungeon-master/#comment-6309734>reminiscing</a> about the copy protection of <a href=https://hol.abime.net/412>Dragonflight</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There was an Amiga RPG, I think by Thalion that made the game crash when the
anti piracy was triggered. However some time later there appeared a full
screen stylized pirate skull over whatever game you had running then. This
was kind of scary because we thought it was some virus until we realized it
was the RPG game that keept the skull in RAM even after a reset until you
turned off your Amiga.</p></blockquote><p>Not an Amiga game, but an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8809505">interesting case</a> nonetheless:</p><blockquote><p>Another copy-protection classic was Spyro: Year of the Dragon:
<a href=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/keeping-the-pirates-at-bay>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/keeping-the-pirates-at-bay</a></p><p>This used a multi-layered copy protection scheme. The first layers would
show a dialog and quit. Later layers got progressively more vicious:</p><ol><li>They&rsquo;d remove 1 out of 10 gems needed to complete a certain level.</li><li>They&rsquo;d randomly corrupt data.</li><li>They&rsquo;d change the UI language at runtime.</li></ol><p>Read the post-mortem I linked above; it&rsquo;s really fun. The basic idea was to
require crackers to play the entire game very carefully, looking for subtle
side effects that broke game play.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so you get the picture. I&rsquo;m not saying all cracks are bad, but quite a
few were back in the day, I clearly remember that. If you were unlucky and got
your hands on a bad crack of a long adventure game or RPG, you just had to put
it aside until you managed to find a better cracked version. I just don&rsquo;t have
time for this bullshit anymore, so nowadays I prefer to play uncracked
originals if at all possible, and I recommend you do the same.</p><p>Now here are some concrete problems that I&rsquo;ve personally encountered with
WHDLoad games. Note that I wasn&rsquo;t looking particularly hard to find faulty
slaves, I just installed a bunch of my favourite games and about half of the
time I ran into some weirdness or suboptimal behaviour. It&rsquo;s surely annoying
for me who knows how these games should play, but it can certainly put someone off for good from
Amiga gaming completely who is new to the Amiga and their first experience
with these games is via WHDLoad. <em>That</em> is precisely my problem with WHDLoad being
recommended everywhere as the magic ultimate solution &mdash; it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s
clever, it might even work well with some particular games, but it&rsquo;s most
certainly <em>not</em> the best solution for many many games, so you should at the
very least exercise caution.</p><p>Alright, so here we go:</p><ul><li><p><a href>Ishar III AGA</a>: Opening the map takes 4
seconds, and closing it around 13 seconds in the WHDLoad version. This
makes the map completely unusable! Bumping up the CPU speed to 50 MHz
reduces the wait times by about 40%, but it&rsquo;s still slow. Whereas when
playing the game from floppies or using the included HD installer, opening
the map is almost instantaneous, and closing it takes less then 2 seconds
with the stock 14 MHz CPU, which is perfectly usable. Because the game
contains a HD installer on the first disk, it&rsquo;s a bit perplexing why a
WHDLoad version even exists in the first place&mldr;</p></li><li><p><a href>Pool of Radiance</a>: Saving the game into a new unused slot takes more than a
minute during which the screen is mostly black (OS swap, a common theme with
many WHDLoad games).</p></li><li><p><a href>Lemmings</a>: The game freezes randomly after about 10-30 minutes of playing
(probably the result of an incomplete crack). To my knowledge, this issues
hasn&rsquo;t been rectified as of 2022, which is a shame for such a classic
title.</p></li><li><p><a href>King&rsquo;s Bounty</a>: Severe slowdowns, probably due OS swapping. Timings when
playing the game on a stock Amiga 500 with the manual HD install method:</p><ul class=compact><li>creating a new character &ndash; 47s</li><li>opening the Puzzle Map &ndash; 5s</li><li>closing the Puzzle Map &ndash; 2s</li></ul><p>And the WHDLoad timings on a stock Amiga 1200 with 128 MB of RAM (!):</p><ul class=compact><li>creating a new character &ndash; 116s (2.5x slower)</li><li>opening the Puzzle Map &ndash; 23s (4.6x slower)</li><li>closing the Puzzle Map &ndash; 8s (4x slower)</li></ul><p>Certain actions in the WHDLoad version are just unacceptably slow! These are
not the only ones, there&rsquo;s a lot more (e.g. when saving the game), I just
didn&rsquo;t bother measuring them all&mldr;</p></li><li><p><a href>Warhead</a>: Saving the game takes a long time and the screen keeps flashing
(OS swap).</p></li><li><p><a href>It Came From the Desert</a>: Speed and music syncing problems (the music gets cut off before the intro could properly end).</p></li></ul><p>Like you would expect, all these games work perfectly fine and without any
issues when run from the hard drive or floppies on an Amiga 500 (you need an
A1200 for Ishar III AGA, of course).</p><h2 id=winuae-configurations>WinUAE configurations</h2><p>So, from all the above we conclude that to be able to play all Amiga games
