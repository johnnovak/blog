Amiga</strong>, <strong>Commodore 64</strong>, and MS-DOS/early Windows era <strong>IBM PC compatibles</strong>
with period-correct graphics. What do I mean by &ldquo;period-correctness&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s
quite simple &mdash; the emulated graphics should look as close as possible to the
output of CRT displays used with these computers back in the 80s and 90s. Now,
there&rsquo;s quite a bit of variance on the most typically used CRT technology per
platform, and these differences matter <em>a lot</em>, as it will demonstrated. The
below dream retro-setup showcases the perfect pairings for the aforementioned
computers (no, it&rsquo;s not mine, unfortunately):</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/dream-setup.jpg data-pswp-width=1920 data-pswp-height=840><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/dream-setup-small.jpg alt="Dream retro-computing setup" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%>Left: a Commodore 64 paired with a small 13" colour TV. Middle: an Amiga 500

may have enjoyed bigger and higher quality displays even back then, but here
we&rsquo;re mainly focused on the experience of the typical home computer enthusiast
playing games (and watching a few demos now and then).</p><p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, my &ldquo;credentials&rdquo; are having owned these wonderful
systems throughout the late 80s and 90s and caring deeply about them. I used
to spend far too many hours doing pixel graphics in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint>Deluxe
Paint</a> on my trusty Amiga 500, got
my feet wet with 3D through
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(3D_modeling_software)>Imagine</a>, and
produced
<a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_artist_modules&query=82371">countless</a>
<a href="https://amp.dascene.net/detail.php?detail=modules&view=2430">modules</a> (songs)
in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProTracker>ProTracker</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTracker_2>FastTracker
II</a>, so maybe I&rsquo;m a bit more
attuned to the accurate emulation of the audiovisual idiosyncrasies of these
classic machines than the average user (or maybe not &mdash; many people who &ldquo;just
play games&rdquo; can be very sensitive to these aspects as well). I&rsquo;ve also done a
fair bit of VGA programming in assembly on my first 486 PC, so I&rsquo;m not a
complete stranger to the low-level details of graphics programming either.</p><p>In any case, this is not about prescribing the &ldquo;best&rdquo; way of emulating these
computers to anybody. &ldquo;Best&rdquo; is highly subjective, you can do whatever, for
all I care, and it&rsquo;s not that some friendly agents from the Bureau of
Historically Accurate Retro-Computing will show up at your doorstep either if
you&rsquo;re not following this guide to the letter&mldr; However, if you&rsquo;re after
experiencing these systems just like people did back in the day (to the extent
current emulation technology allows it) &mdash; whether as a die-hard fan of these
iconic machines, or as a newcomer who is interested in learning more about the
glory-days of home computing &mdash; I would like to think you&rsquo;re in the right
place. In any case, I do hope you&rsquo;ll find this series a worthwhile and
interesting read.</p><p>Finally, while I&rsquo;ve been trying to do my best at presenting technically and
historically accurate information in my writings, the more I researched the
topic, the more I realised how much depth and subtlety there is to it. I&rsquo;m
sure that I had made a few mistakes here and there, and as there is far too
much misinformation circulating about emulating these systems on the Internet
already, if you&rsquo;ve spotted any mistakes, factual or otherwise, I&rsquo;d appreciate
if you&rsquo;d let me know in the comments so I can make the necessary corrections.</p><p>But enough of this lengthy introduction, let&rsquo;s get to the best personal
computer of all human history &mdash; the mighty Commodore Amiga!</p></section><h2 id=the-amiga>The Amiga</h2><p>In the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga>Amiga</a>&rsquo;s heyday from the mid-80s
to early 90s, pretty much everybody who could afford it used their beloved
machine with the iconic <a href=https://dfarq.homeip.net/commodore-1084-monitor/>Commodore
1084S</a> monitor or a <a href=https://www.msx.org/wiki/Philips_CM_8833>Philips
CM 8833</a> (most 1084 models were
manufactured by Philips and thus used the same picture tube; they&rsquo;re
essentially identical monitors). Sure, there were other Commodore models, the
1084 itself had dozens of variations over the years and so had the Philips,
but they all shared the same <a href=https://project64.c64.org/hw/1084s%20Monitor.txt>basic
characteristics</a>:</p><ul class=compact><li>14" picture tube with a 13" diagonal viewable area</li><li>slotted-triplet shadow mask (also known as slot mask, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask#/media/File:CRT_pixel_array.jpg>in-line shadow
mask</a>)</li><li>0.42 mm dot pitch</li><li>15,626 Hz line frequency</li><li>50/60 Hz image frequency</li><li>600-line vertical resolution</li><li>composite and analog RGB inputs</li></ul><p>Practically, they were <em>really</em> high-quality (for the time) and affordable
small TVs with analog RGB inputs. As pairing the computer with one of these
monitors is arguably the most authentic classic Amiga experience<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>,
we&rsquo;ll be looking at emulating this particular display in
<a href=https://www.winuae.net/>WinUAE</a>, the premier Amiga emulator.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/sachs-amiga-demo.jpg data-pswp-width=960 data-pswp-height=720><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/sachs-amiga-demo-small.jpg alt="Amiga Demo by Jim Sachs" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%>&ldquo;Amiga Demo&rdquo; by the legendary <a href=https://amiga.lychesis.net/artist/JimSachs.html>Jim

image for an enlarged version to appreciate the details)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=single-vs-double-scan>Single vs double-scan</h3><p>A significant number of people really dislike the idea of using any kind of
CRT emulation shader and prefer the look of sharp pixels. Well, I used to be
one of them so I know, and if we&rsquo;re talking about emulating 320×200 to
640×480 (S)VGA games, I would still 100% agree &mdash; even the cheapest VGA
monitors used to be tack sharp, and they exhibited none of the various effects
typically associated with CRT shaders (prominent scanlines, halation, bloom,
etc.)</p><p>Moreover, 320×200 VGA was double-scanned at a line frequency of 31 kHz
(you can clearly see that on the blown up image below) so you could not notice
scanlines even on 15" or 17" displays from a normal viewing distance, neither
the effects of the shadow mask because of the very fine, typically 0.25-0.28
mm dot pitch. In any case, even 4k display wouldn&rsquo;t be able to convincingly
emulate the extremely subtle CRT effects of VGA monitors, so unless you have a
8k monitor, it&rsquo;s best to stick to sharp bilinear or integer scaling for DOS
and early Windows games. (And I would go even as far as saying that these
characteristics of PC monitors are not even worth emulating.)</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/vga-crt/vga.jpg data-pswp-width=1024 data-pswp-height=683><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/vga-crt/vga.jpg alt="Wing Commander, 320x200 VGA" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%>Real photo of a CRT monitor running Wing Commander at 320×200

is double-scanned; in reality, all VGA adapters actually output
320×400, so every line was doubled!</figcaption></figure><p>The situation on the Amiga, however, is entirely different. As mentioned,
Commodore monitors were essentially small TVs, subject to SD TV standards. PAL
(NTSC) programmes display 50 (60) half-frames
(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(video)>fields</a>) per second,
interlaced, at 576 (480) lines of vertical resolution. What this means is that
the display alternates between even and odd fields at 50 (60) Hz, and every
field only contains 288 (240) lines, stretched to fill the screen (there is
literally a 1-line vertical offset between the two alternating fields; this is
the cause of the infamous &ldquo;interlace flicker&rdquo;). Interlace is not that great
with mostly static computer generated images having sharp contours, so for
low-res they used the same trick as most consoles of the era: they simply just
sent the display either all-even or all-odd fields, rather than alternating
between even and odd. The result is a completely static 50 (60) FPS image &mdash;
but the scanlines now only have half the &ldquo;density&rdquo; vertically, so to speak,
which is the main contributing factor for the famous &ldquo;scanline&rdquo; look.
Scanlines are much more noticeable on NTSC because of its ~17% reduced
vertical resolution compared to PAL, which causes the lines making up the
image to be placed further apart (incidentally, this explains why
scanline-fetishism seems to be more rampant in American retro-gaming circles
nowadays&mldr;)</p><p>The below photos of Commodore monitors displaying 320×200 low-res in NTSC
illustrate single-scanning very well (enlarge them to inspect the details).</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/monkey-island-ntsc.jpg data-pswp-width=4032 data-pswp-height=3024><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/monkey-island-ntsc-small.jpg alt="Monkey Island, NTSC" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%;text-align:center><a href=https://hol.abime.net/1859>The Secret of Monkey Island</a>, 320×200 NTSC (<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/jdlr4h/monkey_island_on_a_1084s_in_60hz/>source</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/winterscene-ntsc.jpg data-pswp-width=1905 data-pswp-height=1364><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/winterscene-ntsc-small.jpg alt="Winter Scene, NTSC" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%;text-align:center>Winter scene, 320×200 NTSC, 16-colour palette (<a href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2069&p=13621&hilit=winter#p13621">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/pinball-dreams-ntsc.jpg data-pswp-width=1920 data-pswp-height=1440><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-crt/pinball-dreams-ntsc-small.jpg alt="Pinball Dreams, NTSC" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%;text-align:center><a href=https://hol.abime.net/1054>Pinball Dreams</a>, 320×200 NTSC

to which particular systems the people participating in the debate owned. Guys
whose first computer was a PC and grew up with VGA games can rightfully claim
that they never saw scanlines on their monitors, and the pixels appeared as
sharp, chunky little rectangles, while the Amiga and console folk were
definitely not hallucinating either when they keep talking about scanlines and
the beneficial smoothing effects of CRTs on low-res graphics.</p><h3 id=why-bother>Why bother?</h3><p>People are paying big money for powerful graphics cards these days to enjoy
their 3D games with smooth antialiased graphics &mdash; back in the 80s we got that
smoothing for free in the monitor hardware! Of course, the graphics still had
to be skilfully made, but if it was properly antialiased by the artist, the
results just looked glorious on a typical Commodore monitor.</p><p>Below is an Amiga artwork with a CRT shader applied to it that simulates the
quintessential Commodore 1084S monitor (click on it for a larger version, and
click again if the cursor turns into a magnifier glass to have it displayed
with 1:1 pixel mapping). I&rsquo;d bet that most people could not correctly guess
that this is in fact 320×256 / 64-colour pixel art (the actual image is
even smaller; it fits within a 274×216 rectangle). Subjectively, it
certainly looks higher resolution than that; there&rsquo;s an almost 640×480
SVGA quality to it.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/made-scarecrow.jpg data-pswp-width=1294 data-pswp-height=853><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/made-scarecrow-small.jpg alt="Scarecrow by Made" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%><p><a href=https://demozoo.org/graphics/67551/>Scarecrow</a> by <a href=https://demozoo.org/sceners/131/>Made</a> (320×256 / 64-colour Amiga AGA pixel art)</p><p>The image was ×3 upscaled with a CRT shader. Notice on the 200% view
how the shader melts away all the blockiness, increases the perceived
resolution, and adds subtle texture to the image. None of that is present in
the straight ×3 integer upscaled version. That&rsquo;s analog versus digital
for you, in a nutshell (emulated analog, but still).</p></figcaption></figure><p>The gradients and the curves are super smooth, you can&rsquo;t see any jagged edges
and chunky pixels like you would on an objectively higher-quality VGA monitor
displaying the <em>exact same</em> image. But measurable improvements in technical
specifications don&rsquo;t necessarily always translate into better outcomes,
especially when human perception and something as subjective as art is
involved. For me personally, pixel art viewed on Commodore monitors from the
80s is pure magic, and that magic largely got lost during transitioning to the
technologically superior PC VGA monitors in the 90s. From 1985 to about 1995,
a generation of Amiga artists and enthusiast had been fixating their gazes
upon the flickering analog magic that was the Commodore 1084S, and that&rsquo;s
something I think is well worth understanding and preserving. And it&rsquo;s
just heaps of fun! Using WinUAE with an emulated 1084S puts me in a good mood
every time; although it&rsquo;s not perfect, it gets me a little closer to the
experience of sitting in front of a real Amiga. And how long until all
Commodore monitors finally die and end up in the junkyard? Clearly, emulation
is the only practical way going forward.</p><p>Having said all that, it&rsquo;s not all roses with analog CRTs. People fondly
remember the visually pleasing aspects of this display technology, but nobody
misses flicker, vignetting, geometric distortions of the non-flat
picture tubes, just to name the worst offenders. Naturally, we will not be
emulating any of these undesirable elements.</p><p>What we will be emulating, though, is the following:</p><ul class=compact><li>period-correct image dimensions and aspect ratio</li><li>electron beam illuminating the phosphors on the screen (versus sharp
rectangular pixels)</li><li>scanlines (subtly different between PAL and NTSC)</li><li>colour reproduction of the Philips CRT</li><li>phosphor and shadow mask patterns</li><li>bloom and glow</li></ul><p>We won&rsquo;t be looking at emulating any temporal artefacts this time (e.g. motion
blur, afterglow, etc.) as WinUAE has no support for such effects currently.</p><p>Here is a fun example on how the shaders hold up to a real 1084S monitor. The
photos were taken from the <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/games.php?game_id=13">Eye of the Beholder
review</a> published on
<a href=https://www.amigalove.com/>AmigaLove</a>. I highly recommend perusing this site
as it&rsquo;s one of the best online sources of good quality photos of Commodore
monitors, and of course the articles themselves are very well-written and
informative too. Needless to say, close-up photos of CRTs don&rsquo;t nearly tell
you the whole story, but I&rsquo;m actually quite surprised to see the emulated
results to be this close to the real thing!</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/eob-shader-comparison.jpg data-pswp-width=1650 data-pswp-height=917><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/eob-shader-comparison-small.jpg alt="Eye of the Beholder, real CRT vs shader comparison" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%>Comparison of real C= 1084S monitor photos to the CRT emulation presented

include it in my will, I swear!</figcaption></figure><h2 id=a-few-quick-words-about-human-psychology>A few quick words about human psychology</h2><p>Just before we begin, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to point it out that your perception can
play tricks on you, so at the very least it&rsquo;s good to be aware of a few basic
psychological facts about human perception.</p><p>Firstly, we&rsquo;ve been conditioned into thinking that <em>more</em>, <em>bigger</em>, <em>louder</em>,
<em>faster</em>, etc. always equals <em>better</em>. Some of this might be evolutionary,
some just a product of the times we live in, and maybe it&rsquo;s even true most of
the time, but not <em>always</em>. It&rsquo;s very easy to outright dismiss an experience
because it seems &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; according to some preconditioned criteria, but if
you keep an open mind and try to live with it for a while, you might start to
appreciate some of its not so obvious qualities (e.g. a &ldquo;less sharp&rdquo; image
could make gradients and dither appear smoother, gently melt away all the
jagged edges, and just subjectively it might seem more &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; &mdash; not unlike
the certain magic of technologically inferior (strictly speaking) old analog
recordings versus the 100% perfect new digital releases).</p><p>Secondly, the &ldquo;order of doing things&rdquo; matters. Going from sharp to less sharp,
highly saturated to less colourful, louder to quieter, etc., always feels like
&ldquo;losing something&rdquo;. But look away from your monitor for 10&ndash;20 seconds, then
look again at the &ldquo;less sharp&rdquo; image &mdash; wow, now it seems quite normal!
Switch back to the 100% sharp version &mdash; hmm, that&rsquo;s weird; now that seems
too clinical in comparison, and I&rsquo;m not even so sure anymore that it&rsquo;s
&ldquo;better&rdquo;!</p><p>Like I said, I don&rsquo;t want to suggest you what to experience exactly (I
couldn&rsquo;t really do that, could I?); it&rsquo;s just good to be aware of these
mechanisms, otherwise they can be quite perplexing and could cause you to keep
chasing your tail, running around in circles, if you have no idea whatsoever
what&rsquo;s going on, psychologically speaking.</p><h2 id=credits>Credits</h2><p>The shaders presented in the article are the works of Guest, who originally
published them in the <a href=https://eab.abime.net/>English Amiga Board</a> forums
(you can read the original discussion
<a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=61776">here</a>). Since then he has made
his WinUAE shader pack available on
<a href=https://github.com/guestrr/WinUAE-Shaders>GitHub</a>. Apart from the emulation
of the Commodore A2080 monitor which I&rsquo;m going use in this article,
the pack also contains a number of other interesting things, such as an
arcade CRT shader and a recreation of the Sony Trinitron displays.</p><p>Guest&rsquo;s current bleeding-edge shader related work can be followed in the
<a href=https://forums.libretro.com/t/new-crt-shader-from-guest-crt-guest-advanced-updates/25444>this LibRetro forum thread</a>.
Although only available for RetroArch/LibRetro at the moment, it&rsquo;s surely
worth checking out, and we can only hope his work will be eventually ported to
WinUAE in the future once it has support added for more advanced shading
techniques.</p><h2 id=image-dimensions>Image dimensions</h2><p>As explained above, the physical dimensions of an Amiga monitor were
effectively standardised, at least between about 1985&ndash;1995. This is important
because if you play games featuring low-res artwork (320×200 or
320×256) designed for 14" screens fullscreen on a 24" or larger monitor,
it will just look like crap &mdash; everything will look too big and overly
blocky. The best way to experience those old games as their creators intended
is to match the physical dimensions of your emulated computer&rsquo;s image to that
of a 14" monitor. Eerily enough, with ×3 integer scaling you will get
almost <em>exactly</em> that on a typical 24" LCD (just draw a 960×720
rectangle and measure its diagonal with a ruler; it will be the 13" which
equals the diagonal viewable area of the 1084S).</p><p>Now, WinUAE is the greatest Amiga emulator ever and I absolutely love it, but
I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the display settings require pilot training.
Things are hunky-dory until all you care about is stretching the image to fill
the whole screen (just use the <strong>Fullscreen (TV)</strong> or <strong>Fullscreen (Max)</strong>
scaling method in the <strong>Filter</strong> section and set <strong>Aspect Ratio Correction</strong>
to <strong>Automatic</strong>), but once you want to set up <em>exact</em> scaling ratios and
image dimensions, the UI is really not on your side anymore, to put it
politely. Long story short, after countless hours of tinkering, I stumbled
upon the <em>One True Way™</em> of getting predictable results in the exact way
I wanted, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll describe next.</p><p>This is what your <strong>Display</strong> settings should look like. These are the
settings for PAL; of course, you could use NTSC as well, and you might want to
use windowed mode or a different vsync method. But the rest must be set
<em>exactly</em> as shown, and all the <strong>Brightness</strong>, <strong>Contrast</strong>, <strong>Gamma</strong>, etc.
settings must be at zero (they&rsquo;re not related to what we&rsquo;re doing now, of
course, but they could royally screw up things when we&rsquo;ll get to the shader
and colour profile setup later). Ticking the two centering checkboxes surely
seems enticing, but I recommend against it as it will lead to all sorts of
problems (we can always adjust the image position manually in the <strong>Filter</strong>
settings if we have to).</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/winuae-display.png data-pswp-width=825 data-pswp-height=600><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/winuae-display.png alt="WinUAE Display settings" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center>WinUAE Display settings</figcaption></figure><p>Now the <strong>Filter</strong> settings; again, you must set up everything exactly as
shown. With these settings we&rsquo;ll have full manual control over the scaling
with the <strong>Horiz. size</strong> and <strong>Vert. size</strong> sliders. Unfortunately, the
numerical input boxes are read-only, so we must use the slider widgets to set
the values which is rather inexact and cumbersome. The only way for making
fine adjustments is with the cursor keys while the slider is in focus.</p><p>With our settings so far we&rsquo;re getting <strong>×2 integer scaling</strong> with both
sliders at 0 &mdash; that&rsquo;s a nice clean starting point. After some trial and
error, I managed to reverse-engineer the magic formula for applying further
scaling on top of that:</p><p class=center><strong>(ScaleRatio &ndash; 2) × 1000</strong></p><p>So if we want ×3 scaling, we&rsquo;ll need to set both scaling factors to <strong>(3
&ndash; 2) × 1000 = 1000</strong>.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/winuae-filter.png data-pswp-width=825 data-pswp-height=600><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/winuae-filter.png alt="WinUAE Filter settings (bilinear-sharp scaling)" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center>WinUAE Filter settings (×3 bilinear-sharp scaling)</figcaption></figure><p>Like I said, ×3 scaling will give us the authentic 1084s image size on a
typical 24" 1920×1080 LCD monitor. The rest of the article assumes this
display type, so keep that in mind. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iH8YOhiGvKJ7kZogvKv_aDxkX4688T_VXRFAA2exmJs/edit?usp=sharing">This handy
calculator</a>
will help you if you want to adopt my settings to other display size and
resolution combinations.</p><p>Sometimes we can deviate from ×3 scaling with good results. For example,
Pinball Dreams can be enjoyable at ×3.5 if you lean back a bit, and I
like to play Rick Dangerous at ×3.5 or even ×4 because the game
doesn&rsquo;t use the whole screen. Some games benefit from a slightly larger image,
some don&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;ll need to experiment and use your judgement. In any case,
keep in mind that ×3 scaling will give you the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; image size
that people were looking at sitting in front of their monitors back in the
day, so that should always be your starting point.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/ra-einstein.jpg data-pswp-width=1155 data-pswp-height=930><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/ra-einstein-small.jpg alt="Einstein by Ra" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%>Properly anti-aliased graphics look fabulous at ×3.5 scaling too &mdash;

between them (loading a filter preset won&rsquo;t restart the emulated machine). The
quick&rsquo;n&rsquo;easy way is to download <a href=files/WinUAE-Commodore-1084S-ShaderPack.zip>my preset
pack</a>, load the full WinUAE configs (I&rsquo;ve
included one for every scaler setting) and just save the filter settings for
each. Don&rsquo;t worry about the NTSC presets just yet, we&rsquo;ll get to them in the
next section.</p><p><img src=img/winuae-filter-resize-presets.png alt="Filter resize presets"></p><p>As shown on the <strong>Filter</strong> screenshot above, if you only want period-correct
scaling but don&rsquo;t care about the CRT shader (in which case you&rsquo;re missing out
a lot, of course, but whatever 😎), you&rsquo;ll need to use the <strong>Point-Prescale</strong>
shader in <strong>slot 0</strong> with both horizontal and vertical oversample factors set
to <strong>4x</strong>.</p><p><img src=img/winuae-filter-point-prescale.png alt="Point prescale settings"></p><p>This will give you sharp-bilinear like rescaling in low-res modes, but in
hi-res (640-pixel-wide modes) the results will leave a lot to be desired. To
properly fix that, you&rsquo;ll really need to use the CRT shader.</p><h2 id=aspect-ratio>Aspect ratio</h2><p><a href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=348">This</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvckyWxHAIw">times</a>, but far too many people
still get it routinely wrong. Why&rsquo;s that so, it&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery as the
whole concept is not that difficult to grasp. Here&rsquo;s my stab at explaining it
unambiguously with as few words as possible (but not less!)</p><h3 id=pal-vs-ntsc>PAL vs NTSC</h3><ul><li><p>Before about 2005, all commonly used consumer TVs and monitors were
<strong>4:3 display aspect ratio</strong>.</p></li><li><p>On <strong>PAL</strong> Amigas, non-laced & non-overscanned low-res is <strong>320×256</strong>
and the <strong>pixels are square</strong> (1:1 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_aspect_ratio>pixel aspect
ratio</a><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>).
To display the 5:4 aspect ratio image (320:256 = 5:4) on a 4:3 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)#Distinctions>display
aspect ratio</a> screen
while keeping the pixels square, the image needs to be slightly
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarbox>pillarboxed</a> (it fills the screen
vertically, but there are two very narrow black borders on the sides, as
shown on the photo in <a href=http://coppershade.org/articles/More!/Topics/Correct_Amiga_Aspect_Ratio/>this
article</a>).<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p></li></ul><ul><li>On <strong>NTSC</strong> Amigas, standard low-res is <strong>320×200</strong> (because NTSC has less
vertical resolution). The image fills the screen completely and the <strong>pixels
are 20% taller than wide</strong> (1:1.2 pixel aspect ratio<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>). This is commonly
referred to as &ldquo;NTSC-stretch&rdquo; in the popular vernacular.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></li></ul><p>The same rationale applies to every other standard <a href=https://amiga.lychesis.net/knowledge/ScreenModes.html>Amiga screen
mode</a> and their
overscanned variants. The most important thing to remember is that the
vertical stretch factor of NTSC screen modes is <em>always</em> 1.2 in relation to
their PAL counterparts, without exception.</p><p>It&rsquo;s nothing too controversial so far, is it? PAL users had square pixels,
NTSC users slightly tall ones, and the image always filled the screen on both
standards (not 100% on PAL as explained above, but close enough).</p><h3 id=american-made-games-on-pal-computers>American made games on PAL computers</h3><p>Now, the complication comes from the fact that most NTSC games designed by
Americans, originally intended for the US market, were also made available in
PAL countries. As early Amigas with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set>OCS
chipset</a> were not PAL/NTSC
switchable in software (like later models that had the <a href=https://theamigamuseum.com/the-hardware/the-ocs-chipset/agnus/>&ldquo;fat&rdquo; ECS
Agnus</a>, or the
even later <a href=https://theamigamuseum.com/the-hardware/the-aga-chipset/>AGA</a>
machines that had its successor,
<a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=1480">Alice</a>), these
PAL conversions had to use PAL screen modes, which meant the original NTSC
graphics occupied the upper 320×200 area of a 320×256 PAL screen,
leaving the bottom 56 lines blank (assuming low-res). As a result, the art
appeared squashed vertically compared to the NTSC originals (some people call
this the &ldquo;PAL-squash&rdquo;).</p><p>Now what you must understand is that <em>these games were made in America, by
Americans, on NTSC monitors</em> that stretched the 320×200 image to fill
the whole 4:3 screen. Therefore (whether like it or not) <em>everybody on PAL
systems experienced these games incorrectly with the wrong aspect ratio back
in the day</em> (&ldquo;PAL-squashed&rdquo;), <strong>not</strong> as the original artists intended! (Including
me, because I grew up in Europe &mdash; I&rsquo;m not an American preaching to everybody
that &ldquo;Europeans got it all wrong&rdquo; or something&mldr; I&rsquo;m just simply stating
historical facts.)</p><p>Let this sink in a bit.</p><p>You must understand that the <em>only</em> reason for this rather precarious
situation is the technical differences between PAL and NTSC, and the fact that
drawing the art twice for both systems would have been prohibitively
expensive, so no wonder no company had ever done that.</p><p>Now, some people from PAL countries might concur that they only ever
experienced these games with squashed art (and potentially running 17% slower
because of the 60 vs 50 Hz difference); that&rsquo;s how they remember them, and
that&rsquo;s what they want to emulate for nostalgic reasons. It&rsquo;s hard to argue
with that logic, indeed &mdash; if those are your memories, then that&rsquo;s the end of
it. But keep in mind the &ldquo;PAL-squash&rdquo; only happened because of practical
considerations (mostly budgetary limitations); it wasn&rsquo;t a deliberate artistic
or creative intention, but an unfortunate necessity. Then real question is
this: do you want to emulate these games as you remember them, or how their
creators intended them to be experienced? And wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice, after all
these years, to finally enjoy them in their most authentic, undistorted form?</p><h3 id=its-not-just-about-the-video>It&rsquo;s not just about the video</h3><p>Many of these PAL conversions were less than perfect and did not account for
the ~17% slowdown that happens when a game synced to the 60 Hz NTSC vertical
refresh rate is running in 50 Hz PAL mode. Quite often the music playback was
synced to the screen refresh rate as well, which makes the slowdown fairly
easy to spot (if the game also has a DOS port, one of the surest ways to
ascertain the correct music playback speed is to listen to the DOS version).</p><p>Check out this video for a demonstration of the PAL vs NTSC differences on the
classic game Secret of Monkey Island. (By the way, it&rsquo;s worth watching the
whole thing from the beginning, it&rsquo;s very informative and enlightening &mdash; but
at the very least just watch this little snippet.)</p><div class=video-wrapper><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYiBDVw_lzA?start=886" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>To cite a few examples of my own, the music plays noticeably slower in the
following American made games in PAL mode, while in NTSC mode the music speed
perfectly matches that of the DOS versions.</p><ul class=compact><li>Eye of the Beholder I-II</li><li>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</li><li>Pool of Radiance</li><li>King&rsquo;s Quest 2</li><li>Space Quest 3 <em>(probably all Sierra games are affected)</em></li></ul><p>In some better coded games that handle both PAL and NTSC correctly, there is
no difference in gameplay or music playback speed:</p><ul class=compact><li>Curse of the Azure Bonds</li><li>Loom</li><li>Phantasie 1</li><li>Pirates!</li><li>Secret of Monkey Island</li><li>Secret of the Silver Blades</li><li>Windwalker</li></ul><p>The moral of the story is that generally you can&rsquo;t go wrong by using NTSC mode
for <em>all</em> American titles (which includes a significant part of the whole
Amiga catalogue). Without doubt, that&rsquo;s the preferable option; the graphics
will appear undistorted, exactly as the creators intended, and the game will
run at the correct speed, including music playback. (Theoretically, the only
time you can run into problems is when you use a PAL crack of an NTSC game
that somehow breaks NTSC compatibility.)</p><h3 id=running-games-in-ntsc>Running games in NTSC</h3><p>Sadly enough, as Amiga software preservation efforts seem to be almost
exclusively concentrated on PAL releases for whatever reasons, disk images of
NTSC originals are extremely hard to come by. But simply forcing NTSC mode
with the PAL versions widely available online should do the trick in most
cases.</p><p>These are the two best ways to do that when using emulation:</p><ul><li><p>For WHDLoad conversions, forcing a game to run in NTSC mode is as simple as
adding the <code>NTSC</code> tooltype to its launch icon. This will work fine on a
typical emulated PAL Amiga 1200 setup; the game will open an NTSC screen and
WinUAE will automatically apply the correct vertical aspect scaling ratio
<em>on top</em> of our manually set ×3.0-4.0 PAL scaling. That&rsquo;s good news
because we don&rsquo;t need to keep switching between the PAL and NTSC scaling
presets when playing different games. This method requires the NTSC monitor
driver to be installed &mdash; just drag the NTSC icon from the <code>Monitors</code>
directory on the <strong>Storage</strong> Workbench installer disk to <code>Devs/Monitors</code>
on your system drive, reboot, and Bob&rsquo;s your uncle!</p></li><li><p>If you plan on playing games on an OCS Amiga 500 with Kickstart 1.2/1.3 (a
most prestigious choice 🧐), you&rsquo;ll need to emulate an actual NTSC chipset.
It&rsquo;s very simple: just tick <strong>NTSC</strong> in the <strong>Chipset</strong> configuration
section. Now, if you turn on automatic aspect ratio management in WinUAE
(in the <strong>Filter</strong> section select <strong>Fullscreen (TV)</strong> or <strong>Fullscreen
(Max)</strong> scaling and set <strong>Aspect Ratio Correction</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong>),
WinUAE will apply the correct aspect ratio correction right from the boot
screen. But like I explained previously, this only works if you&rsquo;re happy
with the image being automatically stretched to fill the whole screen. If
we want to keep using our exact scaling methods, the automatic aspect
ratio correction won&rsquo;t work, so we&rsquo;ll need to incorporate the NTSC-stretch
ourselves into our scaling factors as shown below:</p></li></ul><table><caption>NTSC image scaling ratios</caption><tr><th width=16%>Scale<br>ratio</th><th width=12%>Horiz.<br>size</th><th width=15%>Vert.<br>size</th><th width=12%>Width<br>(px)</th><th width=15%>Height<br>(px)</th><th width=29%>Equivalent CRT size<br>(on 24"/1080p LCD)</th></tr><tr><td>&#215;3.0</td><td>1000</td><td>1600</td><td>920</td><td>720</td><td>14" (13.0" viewable)</td></tr><tr><td>&#215;3.2</td><td>1200</td><td>1840</td><td>1024</td><td>768</td><td>15" (13.8" viewable)</td></tr><tr><td>&#215;3.5</td><td>1500</td><td>2200</td><td>1120</td><td>840</td><td>17" (15.5" viewable)</td></tr><tr><td>&#215;4.0</td><td>2000</td><td>2800</td><td>1280</td><td>960</td><td>19" (17.3" viewable)</td></tr></table><p>I recommend creating presets for the NTSC settings as well so you can easily
switch between them at will:</p><p><img src=img/winuae-filter-resize-presets.png alt="Filter resize presets"></p><p class=note>If you have vsync enabled, your screen refresh rate <em>must be</em> 50 Hz for PAL
and 60 Hz for NTSC, respectively, otherwise you&rsquo;ll be experiencing all sorts
of weird speed issues (e.g. music playing much slower or faster than it
should). With vsync off this it not a problem, so that&rsquo;s a good quick way to
examine how a WHDLoad game behaves in PAL vs NTSC without having to change the
screen refresh rate and restart the emulator.</p><h3 id=but-life-aint-simple>But life ain&rsquo;t simple</h3><p>No, we can&rsquo;t put this whole PAL vs NTSC fiasco behind us just yet&mldr; The
situation with European made games is a bit more complicated. The complete
algorithm for determining whether a particular title should be played in PAL or
NTSC is as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>For games originally developed by American studios &mdash; always use NTSC</strong></p><p>It does not matter if the Amiga port or the PAL version was made by a
European developer; in virtually all cases they just reused the original
NTSC graphics, and quite often didn&rsquo;t even attempt to address the 17%
slowdown issue.</p><p><em>Some well-known American studios: Activision, Accolade, Electronic Arts,
Westwood, Origin, Interplay, FTL, MicroProse / MPS Labs, SSI,
Lucasfilm Games / LucasArts, Sierra, Cinemaware, New World Computing,
Sir-Tech, Infocom, Access Software, Electric Dreams, Spectrum Holobyte,
Epyx, D.S.I., U.S. Gold, Broderbund, Capcom, SEGA</em></p></li><li><p><strong>For games originally developed by European studios (mostly UK)</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>If the game uses <strong>320×256</strong> or some other PAL screen mode and the
graphics fills the whole screen &mdash; <strong>always use PAL</strong></p></li><li><p>If the graphics only takes up a <strong>320×200</strong> or smaller area of
the screen, that does not automatically mean that it needs the
NTSC-stretch applied to look correct; it might very well have been
drawn with square pixels in mind still.
<a href=https://hol.abime.net/1029>Perihelion</a> is a good example of this: the
graphics is 320×200, but it absolutely needs square pixels
(probably they just wanted to play it safe for an eventual future US
release). Exact same deal with <a href=https://hol.abime.net/1102>Populous 1</a>
& <a href=https://hol.abime.net/1108>2</a>,
<a href=https://hol.abime.net/1125>Powermonger</a>, and
<a href=https://hol.abime.net/2469/screenshot>Midwinter</a> &mdash; can&rsquo;t really
fault them; they just wanted to be able to sell their games in the US
as well, and stretched graphics is infinitely better than no NTSC
release at all.</p><p>Another interesting case is <a href=https://hol.abime.net/2836>Elvira 1</a>: the
graphics actually look good in either PAL or NTSC. Most likely they
anticipated the game to be released both in Europe and the US, plus
they released the DOS and Amiga versions simultaneously, so apparently
they tried to draw the art in a way that looks good in both aspect
ratios (with quite good results, I must add). So in case of the Elvira
games, I think it&rsquo;s really a toss-up. Anyway, you see the pattern here:
you&rsquo;ll need to research the game a bit and, in some cases you&rsquo;ll just
need to use your aesthetic judgement.</p></li></ul><p><em>A few important European studios: Bitmap Brothers, Psygnosis, Bullfrog,

usually appear as perfect circles when the correct aspect ratio is being used,
but in general it&rsquo;s better to look at some common objects and make sure they
appear correctly, neither too tall nor too squashed (human faces and full
human figures are the best candidates for this).</p><h2 id=crt-shader>CRT shader</h2><p>Congratulations, if you&rsquo;ve made it so far, the display of your emulated Amiga
should resemble that of a PC VGA monitor in low-res mode (sharp blocky pixels
and all). But unlike VGA, which is double-scanned at 31 kHz horizontal sync
frequency, all stock Amigas output 15 kHz single-scanned video signals, and
not even the best Commodore monitors could enter the ring against any average
14" VGA display from the 90s when it comes to sharpness (unsurprisingly, since
the IBM PC was originally intended as a business machine, therefore text
legibility was of primary concern).</p><p>In order to simulate the roundish &ldquo;pixels&rdquo; of the 1084S that slightly blend
into each other (the rather nice &ldquo;natural anti-aliasing&rdquo; effect that makes
low-res artwork so much more pleasant to look at, and lends the image this
wonderful &ldquo;fuzzy analog quality&rdquo;) and the subtle scanlines (at least on PAL;
on NTSC they&rsquo;re much more prominent), we&rsquo;ll need Guest&rsquo;s rather excellent
<strong>CRT-A2080-HiRes-SmartRes-Interlace</strong> CRT shader. Clearly, this shader is the
star of the show, and this makes the biggest difference after matching the
physical dimensions of the 1084S monitor. One its most remarkable features is
that it provides seamless support for all standard Amiga screen modes in a
<em>single</em> shader (320×256 Low Res, 640×256 High Res, 320×512
Low Res Laced, 640×512 High Res Laced, and naturally all their
overscanned and NTSC variants). The interlace flicker is not emulated, but
probably that&rsquo;s for the best. This thing handles everything you throw at it,
including low-res/hi-res split-screen games (e.g Lemmings, Shadow of the
Beast, Apidya, Agony, all Magnetic Scrolls adventures, etc.)</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/scapeghost.jpg data-pswp-width=1020 data-pswp-height=828><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/scapeghost-small.jpg alt=Scapeghost style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%>Start scene of <a href=https://hol.abime.net/1841>Scapeghost</a> by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Scrolls>Magnetic

splendidly! I love you, <strong>CRT-A2080-HiRes-SmartRes-Interlace</strong>! ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>I have tweaked the shader settings a little bit, you can download my
customised versions <a href=files/WinUAE-Commodore-1084S-ShaderPack.zip>from here</a>.
They&rsquo;re called <strong>CRT-A2080-PAL-*</strong> and <strong>CRT-A2080-NTSC-*</strong> and have several
variants &mdash; I had to create copies because WinUAE doesn&rsquo;t support shader
presets yet, plus I made the names a little shorter. The NTSC variants push
scanline strength to the max without much noticeable moire/aliasing for the
scaling factor indicated in the name, so for example for ×3.5 scaling
you can safely use <strong>CRT-A2080-NTSC-x3.5</strong>, or the <strong>x3.2</strong> or <strong>x3.0</strong>
variants for less strong scanlines. I created these because NTSC users seem to
have a fondness for scanlines and want them to be displayed prominently. But
you can just stick with the PAL preset if you prefer to keep them subtle
(that&rsquo;s what I do most of the time). The special <strong>PAL-sharp</strong> preset is
designed for text adventures to maximise text readability.</p><p>(By the way, in case you&rsquo;re wondering, &ldquo;the Commodore A2080 was essentially a
high persistence phosphor model of the 1084 to reduce flicker in NTSC modes&rdquo;,
according to the <a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=864">Big Book of Amiga
Hardware</a>.)</p><p>Okay, so this is how to set this up:</p><p>In the <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> section, select <strong>Direct3D 11</strong> for the <strong>Graphics
API</strong> (and leave it at hardware accelerated, of course). Put the tweaked
version of these shaders into <code>plugins\filtershaders\direct3d</code> in your
WinUAE installation directory and restart WinUAE. Then in the <strong>Filter</strong>
section select <strong>CRT-A2080-PAL</strong> in slot 0, and set 2x horizontal and 4x
vertical oversampling. If your have a slower GPU and you&rsquo;re getting dropouts,
you might want to reduce this a little, but don&rsquo;t go below 3x vertical
oversampling (this is essential to make the scanlines nice even and
alias-free; 1x horizontal and 3x vertical is the recommended minimum).
Oversampling takes a big hit on performance, e.g. with 2x horizontal and 4x
vertical oversampling your GPU would need to render 2×4=8 times as many
frames per second!</p><img src=img/winuae-filter-shaders.png alt="WinUAE filter presets" width=auto><p>Detail view of the NTSC x3.0 variant in action on a scene from <a href=https://hol.abime.net/305>Defender of the

CRT experience is emulating the colour profile of the C= 1084S monitor. Most
modern displays are calibrated for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB>sRGB</a>
out-of-the-box that uses <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65>D65</a>
(6500K) whitepoint. This is noticeably cooler (bluer) looking than the more
warmish/yellowish look of a typical CRT from the 80s, which was closer to
5000K (CRT manufacturers more or less just did whatever they felt like back
then; the sRGB standard came into existence in 1996 precisely to remedy this
Wild West type of situation).</p><p>Guest&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/guestrr/WinUAE-Shaders>WinUAE shader pack</a>
contains a CRT colour profile filter in ReShade format
(<a href=https://github.com/guestrr/WinUAE-Shaders/blob/master/ReshadeShaders/WinUaeColor.fx>ReshadeShaders/WinUaeColor.fx</a>),
and one of the included profiles is exactly what the doctor ordered
(information about the different profiles can be found
<a href="https://github.com/guestrr/Libretro-Retroarch-SLANG/blob/main/crt-guest-dr-venom2/shaders/guest/README#L242-L360=">here</a>):</p><blockquote><p><strong>[Profile 4]</strong> Manually calibrated and compared to real Philips based CRT
monitors, running side by side with the shader on a 10-bit DCI-P3 gamut
panel. This calibrated CRT profile covers amongst others Philips CM8533,
Philips VS-0080, and Commodore 1084.</p><p>Note the whitepoint is significantly different from D65. It&rsquo;s closer to
6100K, but clearly not on the blackbody curve.</p></blockquote><p>Perfect! You&rsquo;ll need to install <a href=https://reshade.me/>ReShade</a> into your
WinUAE folder to use this, just follow Guest&rsquo;s instructions from the
<a href=https://github.com/guestrr/WinUAE-Shaders/blob/master/README.md>README</a>. Now
one thing that he doesn&rsquo;t mention is that the shaders depend on the common
<strong>ReShade.fxh</strong> and <strong>ReShadeUI.fxh</strong> files that are not included, so just get
them from <a href=https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/tree/slim/Shaders>here</a>
(all these files are included in <a href=files/WinUAE-Commodore-1084S-ShaderPack.zip>my preset
pack</a>, by the way).</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve set up everything correctly, just enable <strong>WinUaeColor.fx</strong> and
set it up like shown below. <strong>Color Profile 4</strong> is the Philips, most people
should leave <strong>Color Space</strong> at 0 (sRGB), but if you&rsquo;re the lucky owner of a
wide-gamut display then you definitely should set it to match your display&rsquo;s
colour profile (the emulation would be more accurate that way, according to
the instructions).</p><p><strong>Colour Temperature</strong> should stay at zero, and I know it&rsquo;s very tempting, but
don&rsquo;t ever touch <strong>Color Saturation</strong> because it&rsquo;s completely broken. The
default saturation is just fine, but if you really want to have a saturation
control, I recommend prod80&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/prod80/prod80-ReShade-Repository/blob/master/Shaders/PD80_03_Color_Space_Curves.fx>Color Space
Curves</a>
ReShade filter in <code>L*a*b</code> mode, placed <em>before</em> the <strong>WinUaeColor</strong> shader.</p><p>The <strong>Color Contrast</strong> adjustment, on the other hand, works quite well; you
can either leave it at zero, or bump it up to about 0.5 like I have recently.
Some games look quite nice with the contrast cranked up almost to the max,
some look completely fine at near zero &mdash; just like on real hardware.</p><img src=img/winuaecolor.png alt="WinUaeColor shader settings" width=auto><p>As expected, the right half of the below example image with the Philips colour
profile applied looks much more warm and cosy. Now we&rsquo;re cooking on gas! &mdash; this is how I remember my

and the shadow mask that gives the image a subtle, almost canvas-like texture.
Different monitors use different types of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask>shadow
masks</a>; the 1084S and most early
computer monitors have the slot-mask or in-line type which was also
commonly used in TV CRTs in the 80s.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/pixel-array.jpg data-pswp-width=1024 data-pswp-height=492><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/pixel-array.jpg alt="Shadow mask types" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%;text-align:center>Left: slotted-triplet shadow mask (also known as slot mask, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask#/media/File:CRT_pixel_array.jpg>in-line shadow

gives a good succinct explanation on how these pixel-masks are implemented.
Like I said in the beginning, my settings are really tailored for 1080p. At
4k or higher resolutions you&rsquo;ll almost certainly need to make significant
adjustments to them.</p><p>Again, this is not something that jumps at you as it&rsquo;s rather subtle, but it&rsquo;s
missing if it&rsquo;s not there. The lack of it is especially noticeable on large
solidly coloured areas; on a real CRT these were never <em>really</em> solid, there
was always something &ldquo;going on&rdquo; even in these boring surfaces; a faint,
almost subliminal canvas-like texture. Here are the settings I&rsquo;m using in the
<strong>WinUaeMaskGlow</strong> ReShade filter (whether you put it before or after the
colour filter is of not much practical importance):</p><img src=img/winuaemaskglow.png alt="WinUaeMaskGlow shader settings" width=auto><p>And this is a before/after comparison on a blow-up NTSC image. Doesn&rsquo;t seem
like a big deal; it&rsquo;s one of those strange things that doesn&rsquo;t seem to add
much when you turn it on, only when you <em>remove</em> it once you&rsquo;ve become
accustomed to it. It might even seem a bit pointless first, but trust me, just
set it up, live with it for a while, and then turn it off &mdash; chances are
you&rsquo;ll really miss it!</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-dealer-slot-mask.jpg data-pswp-width=1283 data-pswp-height=743><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/amiga-dealer-slot-mask-small.jpg alt="Phosphor and shadow mask emulation comparison" style=width:100%></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center>Left: no phosphor and shadow mask emulation<br>Right: phosphor and shadow mask emulation applied<br></figcaption></figure><h2 id=bloom-and-glow>Bloom and glow</h2><p>Okay, this is really the icing on the cake, a subtle but important final touch
to make the emulation even more authentic. CRT displays always exhibit a
certain degree of halation, which is quite an interesting effect. As the
electron beams illuminate the phosphors and they emit light in turn, the light
rays entering the front glass close to normal angles pass mostly undeterred,
but below a certain angle of incidence the light is reflected back to the
picture tube&rsquo;s surface where it undergoes further reflections. The end result
is a characteristic concentric glow (&ldquo;halo&rdquo;) around brightly lit areas, which
also results in a localised loss of contrast. The effect is most noticeable
when bright text is displayed on a black background, as shown on the example
below.</p><p>The &ldquo;bloom&rdquo; effect is maybe not named entirely correctly, but it&rsquo;s basically
the effect of brighter pixels appearing a little larger and bleeding into
their neighbours a bit more. Sort of a pixel-level, small scale glow
effect that incidentally is also useful to make up for the brightness loss
caused by the shadow mask.</p><p>Luckily for us, the mask and glow shader emulates both phenomena quite
convincingly. The trick is not to overdo it (you shouldn&rsquo;t really notice the
effect unless you&rsquo;re looking for it), so I&rsquo;m keeping both at rather low
strength settings. What I said about the phosphor and shadow mask emulation
holds true for these as well: turning them on might not seem overly impressive
first (if you&rsquo;re impressed, you&rsquo;ve added <em>waaaaaay</em> too much glow!), but when
you turn them <em>off</em> later, you&rsquo;ll really miss the effect.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/eob-intro-glow.jpg data-pswp-width=960 data-pswp-height=720><img src=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/img/eob-intro-glow.jpg alt="Eye of the Beholder, bloom and glow comparison" style=width:90%></a><figcaption style=width:90%;text-align:center>Left: Eye of the Beholder intro, no bloom & glow emulation<br>Right: Same image with subtle bloom & glow emulation</figcaption></figure><h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2><p>Phew, that was one long article, indeed!

machine to a TV, but those were either small 13&ndash;14" TV sets, or if they
used the big family TV, that had to be viewed from a distance, so the
effective image dimensions ended up being about the same (remember, TVs in
the 80s were <em>much</em> smaller than today). The <a href=http://arekuse.net/blog/tech-guides/bvm-pvm/>Sony PVM and
BVM</a> line of monitors seem to
be very much in vogue lately in retro-gaming circles, especially in the US
because of the almost total lack of small NTSC TVs with SCART inputs over
there. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re nice, but remember, the P and B stand for
&ldquo;Professional&rdquo; and &ldquo;Broadcast&rdquo;, respectively. A 20" BVM set you back by
about 16,000 USD in the 90s, and the smaller models were not exactly cheap
either, often costing well over a grand. Now how many home users exactly
could have afforded these babies back in the day? Zero? I guarantee you that
no Amiga enthusiast had owned a Sony PVM/BVM <em>ever</em> before the year 2000.
It&rsquo;s just that companies started throwing them away or selling them for $5
apiece and the retro crowd quickly snatched them up, creating a small hype
in the process — now they command absolutely ridiculous prices on eBay
again. In any case, as using one of these is not the authentic experience
(they&rsquo;re a bit too sharp, have aperture masks instead of slots masks, and
the scanlines are a bit too prominent because of the increased vertical
resolution of 800&ndash;1000 lines), we&rsquo;re not concerned with them here. Another
fun fact: as Commodore monitors had excellent image quality and colour
reproduction for the time (for SD broadcast standards, that is), often they
found their way into professional studios and were sitting next to the
Sonys. You could buy several of them for the price of a single Sony; there&rsquo;s
not much arguing with it that they had pretty much the best
quality/affordability ratio throughout the 80s.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>Yes, I&rsquo;m aware that the pixels are not completely
square in PAL when the Amiga is hooked up to a TV, and the <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=50015">&ldquo;real PAL pixel
aspect ratio&rdquo;</a> is not quite
1:1, but a tiny bit off. The thing is, people adjusted their screens with
the stretch controls on their monitors to taste anyway (hopefully to the
correct 1:1 ratio!), so this is largely irrelevant. Plus it&rsquo;s much better to
emulate square pixels for practical reasons.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3 role=doc-endnote><p>It&rsquo;s easy to derive this from the ratios: 4:3 display aspect
ratio can be rewritten as 16:12, and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)#Distinctions>storage aspect
ratio</a> of
320:256 = 5:4 as 15:12. Because the vertical ratios are identical, the image
fills the screen vertically. However, the display is 16 units wide while the
image width is only 15 units, so there will be black bars on the two sides.&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4 role=doc-endnote><p>Same story as for PAL: the &ldquo;theoretically correct&rdquo;
vertical stretch ratio is not quite 1.2, but close enough that it does not
matter.&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5 role=doc-endnote><p>Divide the 320×200 NTSC pixel-grid size by ten to get
the 32:20 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)#Distinctions>storage aspect
ratio</a>.
Multiply the 4:3 display aspect ratio by 8 to arrive at the same width
factor; that will give us a 32:24 display aspect ratio. The horizontal
factors match, so the image fills the screen horizontally, but not
vertically (because 24 > 20); for that we need to stretch the pixels
vertically by a factor of 24/20 = 1.2. This is the same vertical stretch
factor that must be applied to 320x200 VGA games so they display correctly
on square pixel aspect ratio LCD monitors. (Of course, the deeper and true
explanation lies in the workings of the NTSC broadcast standard and would
require some knowledge of analog electronics; however, for our purposes
here this purely aspect ratio based derivation is sufficient.)&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section><section class=comments><h2>Comments</h2><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return}var b=document,a=b.createElement('script');a.async=!0,a.src='//johnnovak.disqus.com/embed.js',a.setAttribute('data-timestamp',+new Date),(b.head||b.body).appendChild(a)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></div></body><script type=module>
