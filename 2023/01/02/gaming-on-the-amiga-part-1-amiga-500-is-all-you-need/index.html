days is via WHDLoad on an Amiga 1200 (either emulated or real hardware)
expanded to oblivion with a turbo card and lots of extra RAM. I disagree with
this notion for a number of important reasons:</p><dl><dt>It&rsquo;s suboptimal</dt><dd><p>While WHDLoad solves some problems (if you count disk swapping and loading
times as such), WHDLoad conversions quite often introduce their own set of
significant issues, sometimes making the game overall <em>slower</em> than the
original floppy version, or even broken and uncompletable. In many cases, it&rsquo;s
one step forward and two steps back with WHDLoad.</p></dd><dt>It&rsquo;s inauthentic</dt><dd><p>As I get older, I find myself caring more about the preservation of the
original Amiga experience for the future. Even perfect WHDLoad conversions
(and many are far from it) take away from that authentic experience. It would
be a sad thing indeed if these imperfect WHDLoad conversions were the only
surviving artifacts 50 or 100 years from now!</p></dd><dt>It&rsquo;s unnecessary</dt><dd><p>Depending on what games you enjoy playing, WHDLoad might as well be a
completely unnecessary and easily avoidable complication (especially when
using an emulator).</p></dd></dl><p>Am I being unfairly harsh towards WHDLoad? Well, I don&rsquo;t think so, and I must
add I harbor no ill will towards its authors, nor the creators of the numerous
WHDLoad ports. While WHDLoad is certainly a great technical achievement, and
it might be your only option if you want to play older games on later Amigas
equipped with faster processors and later Kickstart ROMs, it&rsquo;s simply not the
ultimate solution many people make it out to be. While no doubt grabbing some
hard drive image pre-installed with all WHDLoad games in the known universe
requires the <em>least amount of effort</em> (especially for newcomers who don&rsquo;t want
to learn about the Amiga), it&rsquo;s not all roses with WHDLoad; it does introduce
its own set of problems not present in the original games.</p><p>If avoiding disk swapping or reducing loading times are your primary
motivations for using it, there are much simpler ways to achieve those goals
(especially when using emulation) while completely bypassing the various
issues that WHDLoad conversions might introduce. These issues range from mere
annoyances to game-breaking bugs which might put Amiga games in a bad light
for people new to the platform (how could they tell if some problem is present
in the original game or the WHDLoad port is at fault?), and annoy oldtimers
like me who are after replicating the Authentic Original Experience™.
Most importantly, these issues are <em>not present in the original games!</em>
Therefore, that is what we&rsquo;ll be looking at in this article series&mdash;playing
Amiga games in their original, unaltered form. That means running the games on
the hardware they were intended for, and no cracks, no WHDLoad, no
patches&mdash;unless absolutely necessary.</p><h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2><p>This guide assumes some basic familiarity with the Amiga line of home
computers. If you&rsquo;ve never used one of these magnificent machines before, or
if you want to get back into the hobby after several decades without having
used one, I highly recommend reading the excellent <a href=https://www.amigaretro.com/index.php/page,1.html>Amiga Beginner&rsquo;s
Series</a> first. It covers a
lot of ground quite succinctly, and if not everything makes complete sense,
don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;ll explain the important things in more detail later. But you
<em>need</em> to understand the basics first, and without a desire to have some basic
level of technical understanding of how the Amigas work, you won&rsquo;t get very
far. Personal computers from the 80s and 90s are not consoles; every user
(including gamers) was expected to have some minimal knowledge of the hardware
to be able to use it effectively.</p><p>Another essential thing: Amiga games look wrong without properly emulating a
period-correct 15 kHz CRT monitor, so I highly recommend referencing <a href=/2022/04/15/achieving-period-correct-graphics-in-personal-computer-emulators-part-1-the-amiga/>my earlier
article</a>
on setting up an authentic Commodore 1084S shader for WinUAE before getting
started.</p><h2 id=a-brief-history-of-the-amiga>A brief history of the Amiga</h2><p>The first Amiga ever, the iconic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1000>Amiga
1000</a> was released in 1985 to the
unsuspecting public, followed by the more budget-oriented <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500>Amiga
500</a> in 1987. These were simply the
best home computers money could buy at that time; it was unbelievable&mdash;as
if someone time-travelled <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535694/the-future-was-here/>back from the
future</a> to bring
the world&rsquo;s first true multimedia computer to us (no, it wasn&rsquo;t the Macintosh,
neither the much later &ldquo;multimedia Pentium PCs&rdquo;).</p><p>The Amiga 500 featured the same Motorola 68000 processor running at 7.14 MHz,
and nearly the same <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set>Original Chip Set
(OCS)</a> as the Amiga 1000. In
Amiga terms, the chipset defines the graphics capabilities of the machine. The
OCS chipset was able to display up to 32 colours on the screen out of
a palette of 4096 colours (64 in the special <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Halfbrite_mode>Extra Half-Brite
(EHB)</a> mode, and all
possible colours in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold-And-Modify>Hold-And-Modify
(HAM)</a>, but this was only
utilised in a handful of games).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> The most common screen modes for games were
320×256 (PAL) and 320×200 (NTSC), but some made good use of the
640×256/200 hi-res resolutions as well.</p><p>The other important defining characteristic of an Amiga computer is the
version of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Amiga)>Kickstart</a>,
which is the firmware part of the operating system. This resided in a ROM chip
on the Amiga 500 and later models. Kickstart 1.3 was <em>the</em> standard Kickstart
for the Amiga 500, but some early models came with version 1.2. Even earlier
versions than that were buggy beta releases and thus can be safely ignored.</p><p>The Amiga 500 was a tremendous success; it sold several millions of units
worldwide (the exact figure is a never-ending point of contention). It should
be of little surprise then that the overwhelming majority of the Amiga gaming
catalogue was targeting OCS-equipped Amigas with 1 MB of RAM running Kickstart
1.3&mdash;in other words, the ubiquitous Amiga 500, the most popular Amiga model
ever, with a 512 KB RAM expansion board which was de-facto standard. This is
quite understandable, as the relatively low price point of the Amiga 500 made
it a very attractive choice for parents wanting to buy a personal computer for
their kids (IBM PC compatibles with similar capabilities could easily cost 3
to 5 times more in Europe). And those &ldquo;similar capabilities&rdquo; of the PCs
haven&rsquo;t materialised until about 1989 (with some goodwill), the year the Sound
Blaster 1.0 was released, and it took a few more years for the VGA adapters
(initially released in 1987) to come down in price so ordinary people on
regular salaries could afford them (especially outside of the US).</p><p>The below comparison screenshots illustrate pretty well the difference between
PC and Amiga gaming in the 80s. I clearly remember the vague depressive
feeling when friends were trying to impress me with some Hercules or CGA game
on their IBM PC compatibles that could only emit weird metallic noises from
the PC speaker for &ldquo;music&rdquo; (<em>&ldquo;If this is going to be the future of &#171;serious
computing&#187;, I&rsquo;d rather be doing something else&mldr;"</em>) To put it simply, it&rsquo;s
rather pointless to play most pre-1990 games on DOS if an Amiga (or even
Commodore 64!) port also exists&mdash;unless for research reasons or due to
<em>extremely</em> strong nostalgic feelings towards the crawling horror also known
as &ldquo;CGA graphics.&rdquo;</p><div class=image-grid><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/uninvited-title-dos.png data-pswp-width=960 data-pswp-height=720><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/uninvited-title-dos.png alt="Uninvited (DOS, CGA) - Title screen" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%>The rather ghastly CGA title screen of

Architecture
(AGA)</a>
which found its way into the successor of the Amiga 500 in the budget
category, the Amiga 1200 released at the end of 1992. It was a rather
lackluster incremental upgrade over OCS and the shortlived ECS chipset (which
is unimportant from a gaming perspective). At this point, Commodore was
basically playing catchup with the IBM PC compatibles. Although AGA made the
use of 256 colours out of a total palette of 16 million possible, similar to
the VGA standard released in 1987 (note the huge five year gap there!), it was
an architectural dead-end. No improvements had been made to the Amiga&rsquo;s sound
capabilities at all (I don&rsquo;t count the removal of the fixed low-pass filter as
an improvement); it was the exact same 4-channel / 8-bit / up to ~28.8kHz
audio the Amiga 1000 introduced in 1985. At the same time, 1992 saw the
release of landmark PC audio cards such as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16>Sound Blaster
16</a> (CD-quality audio, FM
synthesis, optional MIDI daughterboard) and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravis_UltraSound>Gravis
UltraSound</a> (CD-quality
audio, 32 channels, hardware mixer, up to 1 MB of sample RAM). From 1992
onwards, you could no longer proudly recommend Amiga versions of games as the
&ldquo;best&rdquo; versions; the PC had simply taken over and became the leading platform.
Amiga ports had become mostly just afterthoughts, ranging from mediocre to
embarassingly bad. With the eventual demise of Commodore in 1994, developers
started to abandon the platform in droves, and the fate of the Amiga as a
mainstream gaming platform was sealed. Some might argue that the final nail in
the coffin was the release of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)>Doom</a> a bit earlier in
1993, establishing the hugely popular FPS genre. It was simply impossible to
achieve a similarly fast-paced 3D gameplay on a stock Amiga 1200 with the AGA
chipset. Regardless of the significance of Doom in the downfall of the Amiga,
the new line of machines could not keep up with the fast advancements in the
3D graphics arena, and at that time 3D was what most gamers wanted.</p><p>The below charts generated from data provided by
<a href=https://www.mobygames.com/>MobyGames</a> illustrate quite well the fast-paced
nature of technology adoption in IBM PC games around the end of the 80s.
MS-DOS as a gaming platform was going forward at a steady pace like a Sherman
tank; one had to be blind not to see the writing on the wall (and you can be
sure this trend didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by all those financial analysts working at
larger American game companies).</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-video-standard-number-of-releases.png data-pswp-width=4358 data-pswp-height=2129><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-video-standard-number-of-releases.png alt="Video standard support of DOS games (number of releases) between 1980-1995" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-video-standard-percentage-of-releases.png data-pswp-width=4146 data-pswp-height=2129><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-video-standard-percentage-of-releases.png alt="Video standard support of DOS games (percentage of releases) between 1980-1995" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-audio-device-support.png data-pswp-width=4092 data-pswp-height=2096><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/dos-audio-device-support.png alt="Audio device support of DOS games between 1985-1995" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><p>All in all, while the Amiga 1000 and 500 were revolutionary at their
inception, the Amiga 1200 offered only a rather modest evolutionary upgrade to
those classic machines, and overall was a disappointment. It was too little
and far too late. Naturally, there are <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=86674">long forum
threads</a> discussing this in
painstaking detail, with lots of zealotry, name-calling, emotions running mile
high, and&mdash;surprisingly!&mdash;even the occasional valuable insight and factual
information can be found there if you&rsquo;re persistent enough (I couldn&rsquo;t muster
up the strength to get past the 21st page myself in that linked thread&mldr;) My
feelings about the eventual death-spiral of the Amiga and the <a href=https://qr.ae/pvf5zR>general
incompetency of Commodore management</a> is summed up
pretty well in this comment:</p><blockquote><p>I was disappointed, but it&rsquo;s like being disappointed with one of your family; you ignore the negatives and love it anyway.</p></blockquote><p>Just as a brilliant but lazy student would be eventually overtaken by his less
bright but diligent peers, the groundbreaking design of the Amiga 1000 alone
couldn&rsquo;t maintain the Amiga&rsquo;s status forever as the best multimedia computer
without major ongoing innovations. It almost feels like betrayal posting the
below chart, but that&rsquo;s the sad reality for you&mdash;in the end, the
comparatively crude PC architecture, brute force, and the vast armies of
industrious PC clone manufacturers from Asia had won the battle.</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/amiga-and-pc-releases.png data-pswp-width=4725 data-pswp-height=2542><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/amiga-and-pc-releases.png alt="Number of Amiga and PC game releases per year between 1980-2005" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><h2 id=ocs-vs-aga>OCS vs AGA</h2><p>The relative importance of the AGA architecture is a source of endless debates
in Amiga circles. But let&rsquo;s sidestep that and have a look at some actual
numbers instead! Thanks to the <a href=https://hol.abime.net/>Hall of Light</a> online
database, I was able to collect some statistics on the number of commercially
released Amiga games&mdash;looking at the OCS and AGA numbers separately is pretty
revealing. I&rsquo;ve included the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32>CD32</a>
as well; although it was basically an Amiga 1200 with a CD-ROM (plus the
vastly underutilised
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_custom_chips#Akiko>Akiko</a> chip), I think
it warrants its own category. You can check out the raw numbers and the
database queries I used
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15eBazUr5dA2aRdaWNpa4Fi-1Coex0sMTH6nY_hDKXF8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>As we can see, the total number of AGA and CD32 games dwindle in comparison to
OCS:</p><figure class=image><a class=largeimg href=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/amiga-releases.png data-pswp-width=4258 data-pswp-height=2042><img src=/2023/01/02/gaming-on-the-amiga-part-1-amiga-500-is-all-you-need/img/amiga-releases.png alt="Commercial Amiga game releases per year between 1985-2003" style=width:100% loading=lazy></a><figcaption style=width:100%;text-align:center></figcaption></figure><p>The chart quite nicely illustrates that gaming on the Amiga started in earnest
in 1988, a year after the affordable Amiga 500 came out. There was a
golden-age period until about 1991/92, after which the number of releases
plummeted due to the increasing popularity of DOS gaming. The release of the
AGA architecture could not reverse this trend; the Amiga 1200 did not sell
that well, and quite understandably, developers were reluctant to target
anything else than the least common dominator, which was still the Amiga 500.
The decline continued until the eventual bankruptcy of Commodore in 1994,
after which things took an even sharper downward turn. It takes a lot of
goodwill <em>not</em> to declare the Amiga officially dead as a mainstream gaming
platform by 1995.</p><p>These numbers actually put AGA releases into a much better light because most
of them were in fact just rehashes (read: cash-grabs) of earlier OCS games
with minor graphical upgrades. Many people (me included) think the OCS
originals have more character and are thus the definitive versions. Another
sizable chuck of the AGA releases were phoned-in ports of DOS VGA games. Sure,
back in the day every Amiga owner was happy for whatever they could still get

rather well-written:</p><blockquote><p>The primary reason for this loader is that a large number of computer games
for the Amiga don&rsquo;t properly interact with the AmigaOS operating system, but
instead run directly on the Amiga hardware, making assumptions about
specific control registers, memory locations, etc. The hardware of newer
Amiga models had been greatly revised, causing these assumptions to break
when trying to run the same games on newer hardware, and vice versa with
newer games on older hardware. WHDLoad provides a way to install such games
on an AmigaOS-compatible hard drive and run on newer hardware. An added
benefit is the avoidance of loading times and disk swaps, because everything
the game needs is stored on the hard drive.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, people got fed up with the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t play some of
their old Amiga 500 OCS games on their new AGA machines and came up with a
solution around 1996, which was WHDLoad. The added benefit was that it also
allowed running the supported games from the hard drive. Keep in mind that
most people sold their old Amiga 500 and put the money towards buying an Amiga
1200, so for many, this was the only option to play those old games.</p><p>So far, so good&mdash;what&rsquo;s not to like? Quite a few things, actually. In order to
work its magic, every supported game needs a so-called WHDLoad &ldquo;slave&rdquo; written
for it that can perform a number of interesting (and complex) things:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Patch the game code</strong>, so it runs correctly (or rather, with minimal
issues) on the AGA chipset with fast memory present and on faster processors
(68020 at 14 MHz is the minimum for an A1200). This sounds like a good thing,
but it&rsquo;s not always possible to do 100% perfectly for all games, resulting
in sync and timing issues. Also, if not all of these incompatibilities have
been patched up, that can result in bugs or crashes. But that&rsquo;s just the
nature of the beast; you need to trust the author of the WHDLoad slave if
you&rsquo;re going down this route. You&rsquo;re not just dealing with the original game
code anymore, but an additional layer on top of that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emulate the environment</strong> the game expects, for example, an older
Kickstart version or some specific memory layout. Many older,
OS-unfriendly games expect a fixed memory layout (e.g. a stock A500 with
the extra 512 KB slow RAM), and would crash on any other setup. So the
slave needs to emulate the old Kickstart in software and do various
magical things to fool the game into believing it runs from a floppy on a,
say stock Amiga 500 with Kickstart 1.2. All these machinations require
extra memory; in fact, only a few WHDLoad games can run on a stock A1200
with 2 MB chip RAM. At least 8 MB fast RAM is recommended, but preferably
more. This is not a big deal when using an emulator, but&mldr; I just don&rsquo;t
like it. It&rsquo;s too much complexity; there&rsquo;s so much room for things to go
wrong compared to a simple Amiga 500 setup the game was coded for (but I
admit, all this machinery is very cool from a purely technical point of
view).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow high-scores and save games to be stored on the hard drive</strong>. Again,</p></li><li><p>a
cool feature on paper, but many of these games could only store such data
on floppies, often bypassing the OS completely. So the game needs to be
patched to write this data into some temporary buffer in memory, then when
the buffer fills up, AmigaOS needs to be swapped back into the memory
space now occupied by the game to be able to write the buffer to disk
(it&rsquo;s not possible to access the hard drive without the OS, and many older
floppy games start by killing the OS right away). Then the game code needs
to be swapped back, and this goes back and forth for a while. Usually this
results in a black screen, and it can slow things down quite a bit (it&rsquo;s
referred to as &ldquo;OS swapping&rdquo;). Some slaves only perform the writes when
exiting the game, presumably as an attempt to minimise the number of OS
swaps required, but if you forget to properly quit the game using the
WHDLoad &ldquo;quit key&rdquo;, or worse, the game crashes on you, all your <em>saved</em>
(!) progress from your session is lost&mldr; I think this is the #1 issue
that gets every WHDLoad newbie, and I certainly did lose my progress more
than once by forgetting to quit the game via the quit key. Although I&rsquo;m
not 100% certain about the technical explanation, such slowdowns can also
affect games that perform lots of reads during the game, often slowing
them down 2 to 5-fold! Sometimes the WHDLoad version runs <em>slower</em> than the
floppy version (!), which I find plain unacceptable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remove copy protection</strong> from games that use nefarious disk-based
protection schemes and/or custom non-DOS disk formats. Although the
majority of WHDLoad conversions require original uncracked floppy images,
removing such protections is a necessity and effectively requires the
slave author to crack the game. Sure, not having to consult code wheels
and manuals sounds like an improvement, but this comes with all the
drawbacks associated with cracking&mdash;a bad crack can simply render the
game unplayable. This is certainly annoying in action games and
platformers that take a few hours tops to finish (and therefore are easy
to test by the crackers), but in the case of adventure games, and
especially RPGs that can take anywhere between 20 and 100 hours to
complete, a bad crack can be catastrophic. Some devious developers had
literally woven the protection into the fabric of the game&rsquo;s code; it
wasn&rsquo;t just a simple question/response style manual or code wheel check at
the beginning, but the protection was <em>embedded</em> into the game, so to
speak. Moreover, there was no indication whatsoever of failing these
subtle checks, the game did not outright stop or crash but let you keep
playing for hours on end while gradually crippling the experience until it
got into an unwinnable state, possibly even corrupting or &ldquo;infecting&rdquo; your
save files. Needless to say, very few crackers had spent 20-100 hours
completing such games over and over to test their cracks (just think of a
complex branching RPG and how much effort it would be to test
that properly). Here&rsquo;s a few notable examples:</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate:_Gates_of_Dawn>Fate: Gates of Dawn</a>, one
of the longest and best Amiga-exclusive RPGs:</p><blockquote><p>It is notable that from these copies of the game only the copy protection
but not the password protection was removed. Password requests are not made
at the start of the game but at intervals in the game repeated after some
time. Just ignoring these requests or a wrong answer leads not to an abrupt
end to the game, but gameplay deteriorating until it becomes unplayable.
Therefore, a copy of the manual is still required for the right code.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=https://tcrf.net/Dungeon_Master_(Amiga)>ingenious</a>
<a href="https://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/210">protection</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VheNpiSZxf0&t=489s">scheme</a> of <a href=https://hol.abime.net/441>Dungeon
Master</a> had received a lot of respect from crackers
back in the day; it took them a year to fully reverse engineer it. The
protection definitely served its purpose in this particular case!</p><blockquote><p>Additional anti-piracy checks exist in the code, including further fuzzy bit
sector reading, checksums, code hidden as images in GRAPHICS.DAT, and other
fun tricks intended to slow down and frustrate crackers. These respond with
a delay-action effect [&mldr;] It is still possible to complete the game if you
save progress frequently. These checks only hinder progress rather than
making the game impossible.</p></blockquote><p>This commenter is probably <a href=https://hackaday.com/2019/06/25/copy-protection-in-the-80s-showcased-by-classic-game-dungeon-master/#comment-6309734>reminiscing</a> about the copy protection of <a href=https://hol.abime.net/412>Dragonflight</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There was an Amiga RPG, I think by Thalion that made the game crash when the
anti piracy was triggered. However some time later there appeared a full
screen stylized pirate skull over whatever game you had running then. This
was kind of scary because we thought it was some virus until we realized it
was the RPG game that keept the skull in RAM even after a reset until you
turned off your Amiga.</p></blockquote><p>Not an Amiga game, but an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8809505">interesting case</a> nonetheless:</p><blockquote><p>Another copy-protection classic was Spyro: Year of the Dragon:
<a href=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/keeping-the-pirates-at-bay>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/keeping-the-pirates-at-bay</a></p><p>This used a multi-layered copy protection scheme. The first layers would
show a dialog and quit. Later layers got progressively more vicious:</p><ol><li>They&rsquo;d remove 1 out of 10 gems needed to complete a certain level.</li><li>They&rsquo;d randomly corrupt data.</li><li>They&rsquo;d change the UI language at runtime.</li></ol><p>Read the post-mortem I linked above; it&rsquo;s really fun. The basic idea was to
require crackers to play the entire game very carefully, looking for subtle
side effects that broke game play.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so you get the picture. I&rsquo;m not saying all cracks are bad, but quite a
few were back in the day; I clearly remember that. If you were unlucky and got
your hands on a bad crack of a long adventure game or RPG, you just had to put
it aside until you managed to find a working crack. The thing is, it doesn&rsquo;t
really matter if 50% of cracks are bad or only 1%&mdash;you have no way of knowing
beforehand whether a particular game is affected or not. So you can either do
an extensive online research first and hope the answers you find are accurate,
or just resort to playing uncracked originals. Personally, I very much
recommend the latter unless there&rsquo;s no other choice but to play a cracked
version.</p><p>Here are some concrete problems I&rsquo;ve encountered with WHDLoad games. Note that
I wasn&rsquo;t looking particularly hard to find faulty slaves; I just installed a
bunch of my favourite games and about half of the time I had run into some
weirdness or suboptimal behaviour. That&rsquo;s surely annoying for me who knows how
these games should play, but it can certainly put someone off for good from
Amiga gaming entirely who is new to it and doesn&rsquo;t know any better. That is
one of my biggest problems with WHDLoad being recommended everywhere as the
ultimate magic solution&mdash;it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s clever, it might even work well with
some particular games, but it&rsquo;s most certainly <em>not</em> the best solution for
many games, it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> the authentic experience, and it simply puts many
classic Amiga games in a bad light.</p><p>Alright, so here we go:</p><ul><li><p><a href>Ishar III AGA</a>: Opening the map takes 4
seconds, and closing it around <em>13 seconds (!)</em> in the WHDLoad version.
This makes the map completely unusable! Bumping up the CPU speed to a 50
MHz 020 reduces the wait times by about 40%, but it&rsquo;s still slow. Whereas
when playing the game from floppies or using the included HD installer,
opening the map is almost instantaneous, and closing it takes less then 2
seconds with the stock 14 MHz 020 CPU, which is perfectly usable. Because
the game contains an HD installer on the first disk, it&rsquo;s a bit perplexing
why a WHDLoad version even exists in the first place&mldr; (well, I know the
answer: because of the &ldquo;trainers&rdquo;&mdash;which is another thing I recommend
against).</p></li><li><p><a href>Pool of Radiance</a>: Saving the game into a new slot takes <em>more than a
minute (!)</em>, during which the screen is mostly black (OS swap, a common
theme with many WHDLoad games). Of course, saving goes swiftly if you play
the game from the hard drive on an Amiga 500 (HD installer is on the first
disk).</p></li><li><p><a href>Lemmings</a>: The game freezes randomly after about 10-30 minutes of playing
(most likely due to an incomplete crack). To my knowledge, the
issue hasn&rsquo;t been rectified as of 2022, which is a shame for such a
classic title.</p></li><li><p><a href>King&rsquo;s Bounty</a>: Severe slowdowns, probably due OS swapping. Timings when
playing the game on a stock Amiga 500 with the manual HD install method:</p><ul class=compact><li>creating a new character &ndash; 47s</li><li>opening the Puzzle Map &ndash; 5s</li><li>closing the Puzzle Map &ndash; 2s</li></ul><p>And the WHDLoad timings on a stock Amiga 1200 with 128 MB of RAM (!):</p><ul class=compact><li>creating a new character &ndash; 116s (2.5x slower)</li><li>opening the Puzzle Map &ndash; 23s (4.6x slower)</li><li>closing the Puzzle Map &ndash; 8s (4x slower)</li></ul><p>Certain actions in the WHDLoad version are just unacceptably slow! It
doesn&rsquo;t matter how much extra RAM you have; these actions will takes ages
every single time. And these are not the only ones; there&rsquo;s a lot more (e.g.
when saving the game)&mdash;I just didn&rsquo;t bother measuring them all&mldr;</p></li><li><p><a href>Warhead</a>: Saving the game takes a long time, and the screen keeps flashing
(OS swap).</p></li><li><p><a href>It Came From the Desert</a>: Speed and music syncing problems (the music gets cut off before the intro can properly end).</p></li></ul><p>As you would expect, all these games work perfectly fine and without any
issues when run from the hard drive or floppies on an Amiga 500 (you need an
A1200 for Ishar III AGA, of course).</p><h2 id=amiga-configurations-to-play-all-games>Amiga configurations to play all games</h2><p>So, from all the above we can conclude that to be able to play all Amiga games
worth playing, we&rsquo;ll need three base configurations:</p><dl><dt>Amiga 500 with hard-drive</dt><dd>This setup will take care of the vast majority of your gaming needs:<ul class=compact><li>All OCS games that have official HD installers:<ul><li>Most games made by North American studios (e.g. LucasArts, SSI, Sierra, Interplay, Infocom, MicroProse, Cinemaware, Dynamix, SSI, Westwood, New World Computing, Maxis, etc.)</li><li>Most adventures, RPGs, and many strategy games made by European studios (e.g. Bullfrog, Coktel Vision, reLine, HorrorSoft / Adventure Soft, Delphine, Magnetic Scrolls, Level 9, Thalion, Revolution, Silmarils, etc.)</li></ul></li><li>Many OCS games that do not have HD installers, but can be installed
onto the hard drive manually quite easily (e.g. MicroMagic games)</li><li>OCS games that can only be run from floppies (and there are a few tricks to
speed up loading times, too, as we&rsquo;ll see)</li></ul></dd><dt>Amiga 1200 with hard-drive</dt><dd><ul class=compact><li>For the handful of AGA games, which all are HD-installable (as per above)</li><li>The even smaller pool of games where you&rsquo;re better off with WHDLoad:<ul><li><a href=https://hol.abime.net/509>Fate: Gates of Dawn</a> (patched English version with
restored nudity from the German original; confirmed to be completable)</li><li><a href=https://hol.abime.net/6039>Eye of the Beholder AGA I</a>, <a href=https://hol.abime.net/6040>II</a> (fan-made port of the DOS VGA original with superior Amiga sound; these only exist as WHDLoad games, they&rsquo;re very well done and completable)</li><li><a href=https://hol.abime.net/6052>Where Time Stood Still</a> (fan-made port of the Atari ST game)</li></ul></li></ul></dd><dt>Amiga CD32</dt><dd><ul><li>For the odd CD32 game</li></ul></dd></dl><p>Alright, this will do as a proper introduction to the subject. In the next
episode, we&rsquo;ll look at floppy games and how to play them like a man (or
perhaps a woman) of culture! 😎</p><hr><section class=links><h2 id=references--further-reading>References & further reading</h2><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.amigaretro.com/index.php/page,1.html>Amiga Beginner&rsquo;s Series</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://arstechnica.com/series/history-of-the-amiga/>Ars Technica &mdash; History of the Amiga</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535694/the-future-was-here/>Jimmy Maher &mdash; The Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga</a></p></li></ul></section><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Yes, many games do actually display <a href=https://codetapper.com/amiga/sprite-tricks/shadow-of-the-beast/>a lot more
